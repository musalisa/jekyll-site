<h2>What is Thereminvox.com?</h2>
<p>Thereminvox.com covers news and issues about the theremin and other theremin-related musical instruments. More in general, the goal of Thereminvox.com is to investigate the role of technology as a tool for expressive manifestations and the relations between art, technology and the human body.</p>
<h2 align="left">What is the Theremin?</h2>
<p>Invented in 1919 in Russia by <a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/8/index.html" target="_blank">Lev Sergeivitch Termen</a> (also known as <a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/8/index.html" target="_blank">Léon Theremin</a>), the Theremin was not only the first electronic musical instrument, but also the first (and still the only) instrument played without touching it by moving the hands in the space between two antennae, one of which controls intonation and the other the volume.</p>
<p>The invention of the theremin marked a fundamental step in the history of music and gave the world a means of expression clearly prefiguring the electronic imagination and tension towards the immaterial that has characterised much of the artistic and philosophical thought of recent years.</p>
