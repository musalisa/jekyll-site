<p><a href="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/pimento.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-879" alt="Magical Moods of the Theremin" src="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/pimento.jpg" width="300" height="301" /></a>There's only one theremin lounge band, and that's <a href="http://www.projectpimento.com/" target="_blank">Project: Pimento</a>!</p>
<p>Their <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/pimento/from/thereminvox" target="_blank">debut CD</a> holds a potent cocktail of hypnotic sounds from the theremin mixed with swanky lounge tunes from the 40s, 50s, and 60s played in a space age pop style with hints of jazz. swing, and bossa nova...all for your listening pleasure. There are a few songs available in mp3 format to get a taste of what the CD will bring you.</p>
<p>Get out your cocktail shakers and prepare to party in sophisticated style! Project: Pimento is a five-piece band from San Francisco, with a repertoire of toe-tapping lounge favorites from the 40s, 50s, and 60s...all with a space-age twist!</p>
<p>Project: Pimento features the smoothly seductive vocal stylings of the lovely and talented Miss Lola Bombay. Lola, the alter ego of jazz vocalist Lori Carsillo, brings a silky, irresistable sound to the mix...like the olive in your martini! Guitarist Absolute Michael, stand-up bassist Makers Mark, and drummer Top-Shelf Rich are all key ingredients to the band's all-star lineup. And the CD also features a special guest appearance by the noted San Francisco Hammond organ player Nick "Martini and" Rossi.</p>
<p>Project: Pimento also features the smooth sounds of Robby Virus on the theremin. Invented in the 1920s, the theremin was the world's first electronic instrument. The theremin is notoriously difficult to master, since one must "play" the air around it without actually touching the instrument itself. Dr. Virus is one of the world's few theremin virtuosos, and conjures up high-class, jet-set elegance with his smooth melodies.</p>
<p>Worth mentioning is a funny <a href="http://www.chihuahuaplanet.com/PORTFOLIO/FLASH/PICTUREBOOK.html" target="_blank">flashmovie</a> featuring PP's song You Only Live Twice.</p>
