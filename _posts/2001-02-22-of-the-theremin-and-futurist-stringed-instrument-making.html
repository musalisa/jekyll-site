<p><i>In this article Giorgio Necordi examines the technology behind the Theremin and outlines the differences between tubes and transistor technology. Then he describes his project for a new transistor Theremin.</i></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_712" align="aligncenter" width="150"]<a href="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2001/02/01-Lee-De-Forest.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-712" alt="Lee De Forest" src="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2001/02/01-Lee-De-Forest.jpg" width="150" height="299" /></a> Lee De Forest.[/caption]</p>
<p>The date of birth of the first electronic instrument depends on that of the invention of the thermoionic valve or tube (the first exquisitely electronic component) or, more precisely, triode invented by Lee De Forest in 1906.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_715" align="aligncenter" width="150"]<a href="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2001/02/Wladimir-Baranoff-Rossiné.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-715" alt="Wladimir Baranoff Rossiné" src="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2001/02/Wladimir-Baranoff-Rossiné.jpg" width="150" height="222" /></a> Wladimir Baranoff Rossiné.[/caption]</p>
<p>Having defined this, the first electronic musical instruments were the Audion piano invented in 1915 by De Forest, the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070227173439/http://www.obsolete.com/120_years/machines/optophonic/" target="_blank">Optophonic piano</a> invented by the Russian <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030216060312/http://perso.club-internet.fr/dbr/" target="_blank">Vladimir Rossiné</a> in 1916, and the Theremin invented by Lev Termen (whose name was subsequently anglicised as Leon Theremin) in 1917.</p>

<p>Of these three, the Theremin is undoubtedly the instrument that has left an indelible mark on the history of music because its appearance is not only different from that of the other two, but also different from that of any other instrument of whatever type insofar as it is played without any tactile contact: the player moves one arm in one electromagnetic field to control the pitch, and the other in a second field to control the intensity of the sound.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>Principles</h2>
<p>As we have seen, from a <i>theatrical</i> point of view, the operative approach is undoubtedly esoteric and almost metaphysical, but the instrument is actually based on well-known physical principles and makes use of essentially simple, easily understood and easily implemented electronic circuits.</p>
<p>The theremin is based on the principle of a beat generator: two harmonic radio frequency signals are fed into a mixer whose output consists of other signals that represent the sum and difference of the frequencies of the first two. If the frequencies of the two incoming harmonic signals are closer enough, the difference between the signal will fall within the audible range (20 Hz – 20KHz); furthermore, by controlling the frequency of oscillation of one of the two signals, we can obtain a variable audio signal.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_722" align="aligncenter" width="460"]<a href="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2001/02/Block-diagram.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-722" alt="Block diagram" src="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2001/02/Block-diagram.jpg" width="460" height="283" /></a> Block diagram.[/caption]</p>
<p>As can be seen in the diagram, the oscillator 1 (generally operating at 175-200 KHz) is connected to an antenna. Bringing a hand closer creates a <i>virtual</i> capacitor between the antenna and the human body, the value of which (in the order of a few picoFarads) varies in relation to the distance between the two plates (hand and antenna). By connecting the antenna to the resonant circuit, the capacity of the virtual capacitor is added to that of the circuit capacitor in such a way that, by moving the hand nearer to or further from the antenna, it is possible to modify the working frequency of the oscillator: bringing the hand closer reduces the frequency because the total capacity of the resonant circuit increases.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_723" align="aligncenter" width="460"]<a href="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2001/02/Diagram-of-the-virtual-capacitor.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-723" alt="Diagram of the virtual capacitor" src="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2001/02/Diagram-of-the-virtual-capacitor.jpg" width="460" height="250" /></a> Diagram of the virtual capacitor.[/caption]</p>
<p>The second oscillator has a fixed working frequency equal to that of the first at rest: i.e. when the hand is distant from the antenna.</p>
<p>The harmonic signals of the two oscillators are fed into a mixer. Radio technology teaches us that the mixing of two harmonic signals produces a third with a frequency equal to the sum of the frequencies of the first two, and a fourth whose frequency is equal to the difference between them:</p>
<p><i>f1 + f2 = f3</i><br />
f1 - f2 = f4.</p>
<p>This technique is known as beat generation, in which the beat is the result of the mixing of the two harmonic signals.<br />
As said above, if the working frequencies of the two harmonic signals are similar, the signal <i>difference</i> falls within the audible range: i.e. a low frequency signal is generated. For example, if we set the working frequency of oscillator 2 at 200 KHz (f2) and adjust oscillator 1 in such a way that the movement of the hand varies f1 from 200 to 198 KHz, the beat of the mixer output (f4) will vary from 0 to 2 KHz: i.e. an audible signal.<br />
It is important to note that the mixer is the real heart of the theremin insofar as it does not merely produce a simple audio signal but, as we shall see, also determines the wave form that is the voice of the instrument.</p>
<p>The characteristics of the volume oscillator are the same as those of pitch oscillator 1: it uses radio frequencies and controls working frequency by means of an antenna. The only difference is the different working frequency (usually about 350-400 KHz) in order to avoid interference with the pitch circuit.<br />
The produced signal is filtered and demodulated in order to obtain a variable direct voltage that depends on the distance of the hand from the volume antenna, a voltage that is used to control the voltage-controlled amplifier (VCA), the purpose of which is to increase or decrease the amplitude (or intensity) of the audio signal.<br />

<h2>Sound quality</h2>
<p>During the course of my "thereminist" career (albeit more as a builder than a player), I realized one fundamental aspect: the theremin is as alive and full of personality as any acoustic instrument.</p>
<p>But what does a good theremin sound like?<br />
It is not easy to describe the sound of a good theremin in words.<br />
We can say that its inventor described it as an instrument capable of reproducing the tones of bowed instruments or the human voice.<br />
I suggest you listen to the CD <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000006U6?tag=thereminvox-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;creativeASIN=B0000006U6&amp;creative=373489&amp;camp=211189" target="_blank">The Art of the Theremin</a></i> made by Clara Rockmore: the higher tones of her theremin (which was built by the inventor himself in the 1930’s) are strikingly similar to those of the well-modulated voice of a soprano, whereas the lower tones are the same as those of a ‘cello.<br />
The RCA theremins traded in the 1930’s also have a timbre that is very similar to that of a ‘cello.</p>
<p>The sound of modern theremins is slightly worse than that of their predecessors.<br />
For example, the <a href="http://www.zzounds.com/a--25827/item--BIGETHERWAVE" target="_blank">Etherwave</a> of Big Briar (a company founded by the mythical Robert Moog) has a wave form control knob that allows the creation of sounds ranging from those of bowed instruments or the human voice to more exquisitely "synthetic" sounds, but it lacks the clarity and vivacity of the vintage models. Nevertheless, I think that the Etherwave is a good starting point for anyone who wants to begin practicing the art of the theremin.</p>
<p>Lydia Kavina’s theremin (built in England by the engineer Anthony Henk) is an excellent instrument with a practically infinite range and optimal linearity: in brief, a professional instrument. But even this lacks something in terms of quality as the generated sound still has an over-synthetic flavour. Nevertheless, it certainly has its own personality and, when you listen to it, you have no doubt that you are listening to the theremin of Lydia Kavina.</p>
<p>At a cost of $3,500, the latest Big Briar instrument (called Ethervox) is highly professional and its MIDI controls offer all of the benefits of MIDI technology: digitally generated sounds, the implementation of movement-controlled musical sequences, automatic pitch control and the possibility of using external MIDI modules.<br />
I have never tried it but I am told that it optimally produces the sounds of classical theremins as well as those driven by its MIDI interface.</p>
<p>The other theremins on the market include the PAIA Theremax which, although being cheap and entertaining, does not guarantee adequate sound performances. Nevertheless, once again, I would like to underline that it could be a good starting point for aspiring thereminists.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the most important aspect of a good theremin is a constant evolution of pitch throughout the entire range of tones. However, an analysis of the wave form of a properly constructed theremin shows that, as a result of the intrinsic distorsion of beat generation, it varies as the pitch changes: this gives the instrument a richness of tone and expressiveness that is difficult to reach using electronic instruments with conventional synthesis.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_725" align="aligncenter" width="460"]<a href="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2001/02/Images-of-wave-forms.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-725" alt="Images of wave forms" src="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2001/02/Images-of-wave-forms.jpg" width="460" height="107" /></a> Images of wave forms.[/caption]</p>
<p>If we add the fact that the intensity of the sound is freely controlled in a dedicated manner by the movements of one hand, we can see that its expressive potential can be compared with that of a conventional instrument.<br />
<!--nextpage--><br />
The primary requisite of a good theremin is therefore that the quality of the sound: it must be the most natural (or the least electronic) possible.<br />
When we rank theremins on the basis of their sounds, we find that the best have tubes based circuits. I have already said the mixer is the heart of the instrument insofar as it is responsible for what we hear. Both Theremin and RCA used a tetrode, a type of tube that has two control grids positioned inside the electron flow developed between the anode and cathode. The beat is made available by connecting the signals transmitted from the two oscillators to the control grids on the transformer of the anode charge.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_726" align="aligncenter" width="329"]<a href="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2001/02/Diagram-of-a-tube-mixer.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-726" alt="Diagram of a tube mixer" src="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2001/02/Diagram-of-a-tube-mixer.jpg" width="329" height="339" /></a> Diagram of a tube mixer.[/caption]</p>
<p>If we assume that the oscillator produce perfectly sinusoidal harmonic signals, theory teaches us that the beat of the mixer will also be sinusoidal: although this would undoubtedly provide a pure audio signal, it would be of little musical interest.<br />
However, by giving the two oscillators similar (but not identical) frequencies, one of the two tends to assume the working frequency of the other. One important result of this behaviour is that the wave form of the signal produced by the mixer tends to become distorted in such a way as to enrich the harmonics of the signal to the point at which it acquires more personality and a greater depth of tone. Furthermore, the wave form gradually changes as the frequencies of the two oscillators move further apart.<br />
Unfortunately, there is also a contraindication: if the two signals bind too early, the two oscillators tend to assume the same working frequency. This limits any excursion into the lower octaves, which is brusquely interrupted at the level of a few hundred Hertz. It is the task of the designer to limit this phenomenon simply by carefully isolating the oscillatory stages from the mixer: the final result must be a distorted but integral audio signal down to the lower thresholds of audibility (i.e. 16 Hz).</p>
<p>Today’s theremins have transistor or integrated circuits, and the mixers are usually normal pre-amplifiers/separators whose only entry receives both high-frequency signals.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_727" align="aligncenter" width="394"]<a href="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2001/02/Diagram-of-a-transistor-mixer.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-727" alt="Diagram of a transistor mixer" src="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2001/02/Diagram-of-a-transistor-mixer.jpg" width="394" height="320" /></a> Diagram of a transistor mixer.[/caption]</p>
<p>However, even in this case, the signal produced by the mixer may be adequately distorted, but the generated harmonies (which are mainly of the odd type) tend to be unpleasant.</p>
<p>It would therefore seem that tetrode tubes are the best means of generating the beat inside a theremin, although it must be said that electronics is a science of infinite solutions and so it cannot be excluded that it may find a way of designing a transistor circuit that fully reproduces tube behaviour. However, this would probably destroy the simplicity of the circuitry that characterises the instrument conceived by Léon.<br />
<!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>Linearity</h2>
<p>The critical point of even the best-made theremin remains the ability of the player to control its expressive potential. RCA’s advertising brochures of the 1930’s claimed that playing a theremin was as easy as whistling: but this is not really true.</p>
<p>The first difficulty to overcome is the absence of tactile control: there are no bows, keys or pluckable strings; only two hands that move towards or away from two antennas. The only connection between the instrument and the human brain controlling the movement of the hands is what is called <i>aural feedback</i>, which means nothing more than the fact that listening is the only way of knowing what note we are playing.</p>
<p>In order to understand these concepts better and therefore give some idea of what can be done with a theremin, a brief description of how it is played may be useful.<br />
As designed by the inventor, conventional theremins consist of a box placed at medium height in front of the instrumentalist, who has a vertical antenna on the right that is used to control pitch by horizontally moving the right hand towards (higher notes) or away from it (lower notes) and, on the left, a roughly U-shaped horizontal antenna that is used to control the volume of the sound by vertically moving the left hand closer (to the point of complete silence) or farther away (up to maximum volume).<br />
The maximum pitch range is usually 3-6 octaves.<br />
It is immediately obvious that the melody is uninterrupted, in the sense that it necessarily involves a continuous <i>glissando</i> between one note and the next, unless the notes are separated by rapid movements of the left hand that reduce the volume to zero between one note and the next by means of what is known as a <i>staccato</i> technique.<br />
Another fundamental technique is the <i>vibrato</i>: in this case, rapid movements of the right wrist harmonically modify the note in the same way as a singer modulates her voice or a violinist oscillates his finger on the pressed string. By means of this technique, the already rich sound created by good circuitry becomes even more expressive… hearing is believing!</p>
<p>But this description gives rise to a spontaneous question: how do you know how far you need to move your right hand in order to change from one note to the next?<br />
Only practice allows an instinctive answer, but thereminists have developed some facilitating techniques. On the basis of their knowledge of their instruments, they know that, beginning from a closed fist, gradual sharp finger movements until the hand is fully open allow them to increase the pitch note by note (and obviously <i>vice versa</i>).</p>
<p>In technical terms, the physical principles underlying the theremin (i.e. the creation of a virtual capacitor between the hand and antenna) are not sufficient to put what has been said into practice because the frequency of the sound produced by the instrument is not linearly but exponentially dependent on the distance between the hand and the antenna, which means that the movement necessary to pass from one note to another in the lower octaves is much greater than that used in the higher octaves.<br />
This situation has been electronically improved by the insertion of a large value coil (usually of about 40-50 milliHenry) between the antenna and the resonant circuit of the oscillator leads to the formation of a second resonant circuit consisting of the coil itself and the virtual capacitor. The hand movements modifying the capacity of the virtual capacitor also change the resonance frequency of the new circuit, which in turn magnifies the resonance frequency of the oscillator circuit. The final result is an increase in the extension and linearity of the produced sound, which allows the movement of the hands to produce roughly similar variations throughout the pitch range. During the design phase, the inductance of the antenna must be calculated in such a way that the inductor-virtual capacitor circuit resonates at a slightly frequency than the resonant circuit of the oscillator connected to the antenna.</p>
<p>In addition to this increase in the linearity of the response, it is also important to underline the considerable increase in the range of pitch. When the working frequencies of the oscillators are approximately 200 kHz, the variation in frequency induced by the virtual hand/antenna capacitor is of a few hundred Hz, whereas the introduction of a second resonant circuit by means of antenna inductance allows a beat with a range of some thousands of Hz, which generally correspond to 4-6 musical octaves. It has to be said that, without using antenna inductance, a greater range can be reached by increasing the working frequency of the oscillators to 600-800 kHz but, in this case, there may be binding problems and, in any case, the linearity of the response will be completely lost.<br />
<!--nextpage--><br />
After this technical digression, we can say that another indispensable requisite of a good theremin is its linearity of response and consequent range of pitch.<br />
Léon Theremin understood this from the beginning and, for what is here called antenna inductance, he used coils that were 4-6 cm wide and had a height of sometimes more than 20 cm. They were totally wound by hand, which ensured the optimal linearity of the instrument: the RCA theremins were also built using these techniques.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_728" align="aligncenter" width="117"]<a href="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2001/02/Self-built-antenna-coil.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-728" alt="Self-built antenna coil" src="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2001/02/Self-built-antenna-coil.jpg" width="117" height="200" /></a> Self-built antenna coil.[/caption]</p>
<p>I can assure you that the use of large coils, which necessarily need to be wound by hand (hundreds of metres of 0.2 enamelled copper wires) is infinitely preferable to using the small ready-made commercial inductors because their larger diameter increases the capacitance between one winding and another, and this helps to correct linearity.<br />
In order to ensure that a large inductor works correctly, it must be vertically positioned below and in line with the pitch antenna because the wide electromagnetic field it produces must in some way be in phase with that radiated by the antenna because the action of the hand in the electromagnetic field of the antenna has a simultaneous effect on that radiated by the inductor, and probably contributes towards providing maximal linearity. In the case that the inductor is positioned horizontally, linearity is considerably reduced and leads to a certain instability in the central octave.</p>
<p>In the case of Big Briar’s <a href="http://www.zzounds.com/a--25827/item--BIGETHERWAVE" target="_blank">Etherwave</a>, the antenna inductance is created by four standard 10 mH elements, each of which is mounted on the printed circuit. This considerably increases pitch extension (5-6 octaves), but the effect is linear only in the case of the central octaves, whereas the lower and upper octaves are shrunk.<br />
Other commercially available theremins, such as PAIA’s Theremax, do not use antenna inductance and simply increase the working frequency of the oscillators; but this does not ensure linearity.<br />
The theremin of Lydia Kavina is something of a puzzle: the case is too small to contain large inductors but, after having seen it in action, I have to admit that its linearity is optimal: its builder probably identified presumably complex alternative solutions in terms of circuitry.<br />
I have no information concerning the Ethervox but, given that it is an essentially digital instrument, I imagine that its linearity is optimal. Furthermore, the fact that it is possible to switch off the continuous <i>glissando</i> in order to take advantage of the automatic pitch control means that the problem should not arise. My only doubt is that, although it is undoubtedly a theremin, it tends to be more similar to a movement-controlled computer – something like passing from a traditional guitar to the MIDI guitars introduced by Roland and Casio ten years ago.</p>
<p>The use of antenna inductances is also valid in the volume control circuit, but this has less to do with the need for linearity in the circuit response to hand movements and is largely due to the need to ensure a wide range of oscillator frequency in such a way that the corresponding control voltage is capable of having a profound effect on the VCA.<br />

<h2>Experience</h2>
<p>I started building theremins in 1997 on the basis of my amateur experience in the field of electronics.<br />
My first theremin was made using transistors and only had a pitch antenna: the design involved the use of a transistorised oscillator connected to the antenna and an integrated circuit (NE602) used in the radio apparatuses, which served as a second oscillator and mixer. The result was a highly stability but decidedly poor sound.<br />
I subsequently decided to begin using electronic valves by building the Tube Theremin proposed on the Net by Doug Forbes. This instrument uses easily found 12AU7 triodes, and the mixer stage is made of a triode tnat acts as a preamplifier; once again, the sound is not the best and I also had some difficulty in obtaining an adequately incisive volume control. Nevertheless, it is a good starting point for anybody who wants to become familiar with building tube theremins.<br />
As I was not completely satisfied with the results I had achieved, I decided to buy a commercial theremin to use as an initial reference. I chose Big Briar’s <a href="http://www.zzounds.com/a--25827/item--BIGETHERWAVE" target="_blank">Etherwave</a> mainly for economic reasons, but I consider it a good instrument, well made and fun to play. It also has the enormous advantage of being easily transportable.</p>
<p>My current experiments are following two parallel routes: the final assembly of a tube theremin made using the same design logic as that built by Leon Theremin for Clara Rockmore, and the design of a easy-to-build transistor circuit for novices that possesses at least some of of the characteristics mentioned above.</p>
<p>The idea of building a new tube theremin came to me me after I had heard Clara Rockmore’s disc <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000006U6?tag=thereminvox-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;creativeASIN=B0000006U6&amp;creative=373489&amp;camp=211189" target="_blank">The Art of the Theremin</a></i>. The instrument used by this <i>virtuoso</i> performer has such an excellent sound that, when you first hear it, you have the impression of being in the presence of an opera singer or, depending on the piece, a ‘cello.<br />
On searching the Internet, I found the circuit diagram of Ms. Rockmore’s theremin drawn by Robert Moog at the time of his electronic restoration of the instrument some twenty years ago.<br />
The circuit was very similar to that of the RCA theremins, but there were some differences which I felt must be the key to its incredible sound.<br />
After spending months studying the diagram, the breakthrough came as a result of correspondence with Reid Welch, who has built a tube theremin that has an exceptional sound. Reid made me understand that the secret of producing an excellent sound was the use of a tetrode for the mixer circuit. Like the RCA theremins, the original circuit made use of a 24A tetrode, a 1020’s valve that has been out of production for more than half a century and so, for my own experiments, I used a 36 tetrode (the direct successor of the 24A) which, although also being out of production is much easier to find and less expensive.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_730" align="aligncenter" width="460"]<a href="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2001/02/Detail-of-Clara-Rockmores-theremin.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-730" alt="Detail of Clara Rockmore's theremin" src="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2001/02/Detail-of-Clara-Rockmores-theremin.jpg" width="460" height="230" /></a> Detail of Clara Rockmore's theremin<br />(Image courtesy of Thereminworld.com).[/caption]</p>
<p>If we look at a detail of the diagram drawn by Moog, we can see that the signals coming from the oscillators are connected to the mixer (a 24A tetrode) by means of variable resistors, thus allowing them to be mixed in such a way as to obtain a satisfactory audio beat. Another interesting aspect of the circuit is the variable capacitor known as the <i>coupling trim</i>: this forces the connection between the oscillators with the aim of controlling the amount of beat distorsion. Finally, we can see that the anode of the tetrode has an interstage transformer, the characteristics of which influence the beat.<br />
<!--nextpage--><br />
Let us now look at the original diagram of an RCA theremin. It also used a 24A tetrode (the RCA equivalent was called UX224), but there is no control of the intensity of the signals coming from the oscillators nor the variable capacitor for forcing the binding; furthermore, the interstage transformer has a different tranformation ratio. It is these particulars that lead to the substantial difference between the sound of the RCA theremins and the better sound of Clara Rockmore’s theremin.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_731" align="aligncenter" width="468"]<a href="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2001/02/Detail-of-RCAs-theremin.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-731" alt="Detail of RCA's theremin" src="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2001/02/Detail-of-RCAs-theremin.jpg" width="468" height="472" /></a> Detail of RCA's theremin.[/caption]</p>
<p>The need for the second project (the transistor theremin) arose from the periodic requests of people consulting my site and asking me for a simple and reliable circuit that they could build. In the past, I provided them with the diagram of the theremin created by TECI (<a href="http://theremin.ca/" target="_blank">Theremin Enthusiasts Club International</a>). I had personally never tried it, but various correspondence had convinced me that it could be a good starting point for a self-builder. Unfortunately a number of people were unable to complete the proposed schema, and so I girded up my patience and started testing the circuit. I soon found myself faced by two problems: the components are difficult to find in Italy, and the final result using equivalent components is far from being a good starting point.<br />
The next decison was to adjust the circuit radically in an attempt to obtain one that worked as it should.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_732" align="aligncenter" width="135"]<a href="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2001/02/Tetrode-36.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-732" alt="Tetrode 36" src="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2001/02/Tetrode-36.jpg" width="135" height="300" /></a> Tetrode 36.[/caption]</p>
<p>My objective was to give the instrument an appreciable sound: using transitor circuits of simple conception, we now know that you often have to make compromises that are difficult to digest. The main problem is to design a mixer that allows a good distortion of the audio signal without becoming too metallic and unnatural, and without limiting the range of the lower frequencies.<br />
I achieved this by constructing a mixer that provides an optimal signal range at all frequencies, but drastically limits the distortion, which is provided at a later stage represented by a transistorised preamplifier that blandly works in the saturation area. As described, this solution could make one screw up one’s nose because we find ourselves in the presence of the generation of odd harmonics, but I can assure you that the result is excellent and, furthermore, by controlling the point of saturation using a knob, it is possible to regulate the desired sound well.<br />
The second objective was obviously to provide a good range of pitch and good linearity. Not wanting to make the design over-heavy by using self-built coils (often an insurmountable difficulty for amateur builders), I limited myself to using standard inductors connected in series to the pitch antenna. The result was an increase in range from two to six octaves and a linearity which, although not optimal, I considered to be sufficient for an instrument intended to be a starting point.<br />
At the time of writing, the project is still being tested, but I shall soon publish an account that should allow any amateur builder to meet the challenge.<br />

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>During the course of this article, I have compared a theremin constructor with an acoustic instrument. This comparison is not as far fetched as it may seem at first.<br />
Starting from an original design, the maker of a stringed instrument must take the greatest care in choosing what woods to use, how to cut them, how to assemble them using the right glues; and then he has to mount the most suitable mechanical parts in such a way as to balance the considerable play of stresses produced by the tightened strings. The result must be an instrument that sounds good and whose starting characteristics do not change too much over time.<br />
Starting from a good initial diagram, a theremin builder must also select the most suitable electronic components, assemble the circuits in such a way that the radio frequency oscillators do not reciprocally disturb the way in which it works, and wind large coils and position them correctly. It is not unusual that, having tried the instrument, he decides to adjust the circuitry in order to increase or diminish the connection phenomenon of the mixer, or to vary the working frequency of the oscillators. All radio frequency circuits have some intrinsically critical points and so it is essential that these are taken into account by the builder when arranging the electronic components, as well as in creating the form of the chassis on the basis of the positioning of the antenna and the large inductors (for example, the latter tend to be very sensitive to nearby metal objects).<br />
I shall never get tired of repeating that the theremin is a conceptually simple instrument that can be made with a handful of electronic components, but the influx that each section has on the others is often so difficult to control that, before managing to obtain a truly singing instrument, it is necessary to revise many times the design and assembly down to the finest detail.</p>
<p>If I can be allowed one final word, the dimension of a theremin builder would not have displeased the Italian Futurists contemporaries of Leon Theremin, art at the service of technology… and of course <i>vice versa</i>.<br />
