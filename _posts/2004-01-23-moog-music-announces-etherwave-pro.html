<p>ASHEVILLE, N.C. (January 2004)--Moog Music announces the Etherwave Pro, a fully professional theremin with unexcelled tone and response. Its features and portability make it ideal for both stage and studio use. It is the latest development in Moog Music's fifty-year history of building high quality theremins. Bob Moog calls it his best sounding theremin ever. "The Etherwave Pro will set a new standard for design and workmanship for electronic instruments." Michael Adams, Moog President, adds “As the leader in theremins our customers have been requesting a professional theremin with greater range and portability, the Etherwave Pro accomplishes both of these objectives in a package that matches the intrigue that all theremin players enjoy on stage.”</p>
<p>The Etherwave Pro covers the entire musical pitch range, up to four octaves above middle C, in three panel-selectable pitch registers. In addition to its outstanding musicality and range, the Etherwave Pro is a visually stunning instrument in a unique blend of futuristic and retro styling with striking vertical lines, nickel plated knobs, and a birds-eye maple front panel.</p>
<p>TIMBRE<br />
A multi-position timbre selector offers a variety of musically rich waveforms, including the authentic traditional theremin tone. In addition, waveform, brightness, and filter panel controls enable musicians to balance the timbre to suit their musical requirements.</p>
<p>ANTENNAS<br />
The Etherwave Pro's antennas conform to the traditional theremin standard. The pitch antenna is a straight vertical rod, while the volume antenna is a horizontal loop. Both right-handed and left-handed configurations will be available.</p>
<p>RESPONSE<br />
Responses of the Etherwave Pro's pitch and volume antennas to the musician's hand motions are carefully tailored for smoothness and uniformity. Player-accessible response adjustments are provided on the front panel.</p>
<p>EXTENSIBILITY<br />
The Etherwave Pro's control voltage output allows it to interface with the Minimoog Voyager or effects modules such as Moogerfoogers.</p>
<p>The Etherwave Pro will be introduced at Winter NAMM 2004 in Anaheim; stop by booth 6205 to check it out. It will sell for around $1000 and is expected to ship by the end of the first quarter 2004.</p>
