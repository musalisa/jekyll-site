    Dialog

    Steve, greetings. Long time, no talk.

    I have read only part of the first page of your side of the story. Of course, I'm upset, still, and old wounds are reopened here. I hurt.
    I withdrew from the hobby, and from contact with theremin people in the years after Clara's death.

    I knew in the months leading to that last visit in the summer of '97, that both her physical self and her mental state were fading.

    Periods, then moments, of lucidity. The old Clara would come through. But, more and more, she would speak to me by phone with evident paranoia---her fear that she was being ignored, or mentally abused. Somehow, she always trusted me.

    Even at that time, that spring and summer, when even YOU were not allowed to see her. No-one in your family could see her, she would see me.

    In fact, she demanded, by phone (I did not record the date), probably in the late spring of that year. It rang.

    First, let me say that as a piano technician and also as a theremin-tone expert and electronics technician, and also because I'm known as pretty sweet guy, she trusted and admired my mix of personal qualities. Her instinct for adjudging people, she thought was without fail. Of course, that was not true.

    But she called, and I can only paraphrase closely as memory allows:

    "Reid! This is Clara. WHEN can you come to New York? I need you! I have here the schematics for my instrument. I want you to copy them. It's vital that you come as soon as you can come. They are right here in a drawer. YOU can make the sound. YOU can make more instruments like mine. Come!

    And so, that was Clara, with a new obsession: get the plans to Reid.

    So, the theremin convention was, by coincidence, scheduled.
    I was to attend. I had decided to drive, make a road trip, and see Clara on the way up, and then spend time with her when I swung back through New York.

    She agreed, was delighted, when I offered, "I'll come up on June, I'm going to the convention. You know, it would be grand if you would speak a few words of introduction to my tape recorder, for the benefit of the opening session of the convention in Portland.

    Clara was thrilled at that opportunity, "But of course!'"

    Steve Martin was there. Bob Moog, when he heard the short address, which we played through a theremin stand-speaker,

    Bob exclaimed, ear-to-ear grin, "My GOD, man! How did you do that? How did you convince her to give you her voice? Why, she hasn't even returned any of my calls or letters for years now."

    She did this for me because she trusted me. In her shrinking opinion of the good-vs-bad world, all of you were rats, to be shunned. Senile dementia, definitely.

    Here's where and when I fell afoul with Martin. That night, out of doors to have a smoke, I came across Steve Martin. We were alone. Paraphrased, small talk: "Damn sun. Eats my face." (skin cancer trouble for Steve. And then, and this is not paraphrased, he said to me (quite surely concerned that I was an interloper and a threat),

    "You know, Reid, you should know, that I own Clara Rockmore."

    That was it. I bid him goodnight. I now knew I was in for some shit to come. I knew that when I went back to NYC, and was slated to stay for a week, that I'd be interviewing Clara for the last time.

    I got that recording. It was pitiful, touching, and showed only the essence of the real Clara: the Clara who would give her very life, if only that would save her instrument from obscurity.

    I knew, already, from the first swing-through on the way to Portland, that Clara was confused. "Where are the schematics?"

    "Over there, in the drawer", she waved from her seat at the table.

    I looked for half an hour. Drawers and drawers and shelves full of entirely mixed-up memorabilia, records, clippings. NO schematic.

    I realized that on the way back I'd need a week to be safe, to sift through every paper I might find. And that I did. And as I begain, I found fascinating documents from the start.

    Across the street, just right across the street, was a self-service copy place. I decided, with Clara's clear permission (though she would forget things instantly, if we explained what-and-why, she fully understood)

    "I would like to make photostats of everything I find here of interest, to ensure there is back-up for everything."

    "Of course, fine." All of it was to go to the IPAM. I knew the IPAM. I even met the director and the founder on my drive up from Miami. I had a formal meeting with those two men, one of which is named Gregor Benko (founder). I forget at this time the Director's name.

    Because Clara had assured me time and again, "All of my papers are going to the IPAM." And your instrument? "It's going there with all of my papers. It's all going to the IPAM."

    I related all this to the two principles of the IPAM.
    I was upbeat, happy to know that Clara's unique instrument would not be lost from public view.

    I'd done so much to help her with that instrument, buying and mailing to her home, boxes of spare tubes of the type that it used.

    I collated through boxes of taken-out "junk" (but original components) and centralized all that stuff, along with the tubes,
    and so it would all be together with the instrument, not lost nor discarded as trash.

    The IPAM officials were beaming by the time I left.

    It wasn't until I spoke to you in NYC, Steve, after I finagled and wrangled Clara to even let you and your bride set foot in her doorway, that I learned the truth: Her instrument was not slated to go to the IPAM. Clara had never updated her will. The instrument would go to Dalit Warshaw, daughter of Clara's friend.

    I knew, by the time of the Martin meeting in Portland Maine, that I was marked for excision from Clara by Steve. If ever there were a modern Rasputin, he is or was that Steven Martin I knew then.

    I knew Steve from late '94 onward. I had been, one time in his apartment, along with my mate, and he was gracious to us.
    And he had lots of Clara memorabilia, including the gift he gave to us: a spare, original copy of her Town Hall performance broadside.

    So, that is the only original Clara Rockmore archive document I hold today.
    I also hold a tiny contact-print snapshot of Clara in 'thirties street dress; saucy hat, glamorous look. She presented that to me herself, "THIS is for you to have, and for no-one else. This is how I want you to think of me. "

    But I should share it, alright? "NO! There are hundreds and hundreds of other pictures of me. Share all of them as you like, but this one is for you."

    You know, Steve, I never lie. Sometimes I'll fail to recall correctly,
    but, here you say:


    "Unfortunately, we don’t think that today. While Reid returned most (although almost certainly not all) of the original documents,"

    ON WHAT BASIS, on what authority, on what "fact" can you say that I did not return every scrap that I trotted across the street and back, in dozens of trips to copy all that stuff? Your statement terms me to be a thief.

    And why did I feel the need to copy it all?"
    Because! Steve Martin was about to excise me from her life.
    And oh! Yeah, now I recall (this is written in real time, I'm not proofing or editing).

    ==Back to Portland, June, the convention, my conversation with Steve.

    Me: "She called me, insisting that I have a good copy of her theremin schematic. I spent an hour looking through drawers on my visit to her the other day, but no schematic was to be found."

    Steve: "Oh, don't worry. I have that at my place."

    And it went on from there. Steve was most worried, apparently, that I was going to supplant him in Clara's affections.

    All that I ever wanted was to comfort, calm her failing peace of mind; to settle her down, to know that I would carry on after her, technical explorations, and share all that I learned from her instrument.

    But, I was about to be axed.
    Two people insured this would happen.
    Steven Martin, after I'd left with my boxes of -her- memorabila in photostat form,

    Steve Martin conferenced with Clara, and told her to this effect,

    "You know, people are not what they seem to be. Reid has raided your archive and stolen your papers and now he is selling them on the internet."

    And you, Steve Sherman, did nothing to disabuse Clara of that filthy lie.

    And you, Steve, you would'nt have gotten your foot in the door, to meet me in Clara's home, had I not worked so hard toward that end.

    You, know, you remember how I spoke to you on the phone, to your father, too, and that I pledged to break the ice in her mind,
    and get your family back into Clara's life.

    The trip I made across the park, to bear a note from Clara to Newta. I met Newta. I recall her like yesterday, tears in her eyes,
    because even Newta was being shunned from seeing Clara.

    And I did my damndest to get all of you back into her life.
    I made some repairs in that direction, for I got you back inside.

    You did not take me to lunch, but, perhaps I forget.

    I only know today, that I left a big envelope with all of her loose photos with you, you promising to copy them and share them with me so we could put them online. You were humoring me.
    I was your fool.

    I kissed Clara a last goodbye that summer. A month later, less, I was poison, so far as she was concerned.

    You participated by inaction, in a character assassination.
    You exploited the situation, let Steve Martin, the crook and liar, destroy Clara's trust in me.

    And today, I have all those boxes of archive photostats, untouched, even by myself. I can't bear to look through the data.

    I'm a sensitive person. Read that again: I'm a sensitive person.
    Clara said so, and noted, that's why she had me in her life.

    I could not tell her that Martin was "borrowing" from her archives.
    All I could do, in the days that I had, was to copy every last damn bit of it that I could handle.

    I did not find the main schemantic. I only found the power supply schematic. I told that fact to Steve, before his "I own Clara Rockmore" statement in Portland. Steve, interested, said,
    "Really? I've never seen the power supply drawing. Now just which drawer is that in."

    Reid as the grrreat Predicto (I need fun, even during diatribes):

    Prediction: Your family, in bundling Clara's papers, never came across her instrument's power supply drawing. Now you know why.
    And you never found the main schematic.

    And you didn't find a half-dozen or so original letters of Lev's, in Russian, to Clara (I have photostats, so does Glinsky).

    You never found a lot of things because you know, Steve always had fingers that clutch better than they let go.

    If you would like the entire 1000 plus pages (all numbered) that I have in photostat form here, you're welcome to them.

    It has been ten years. No sale of any Clara document has ever shown up, has it? So, so much for that lie you let Martin put into Clara's head,

    that damnable lie which you chose to perpetuate in your March essay above.

    I was in error. She was right to have kicked all you Shermans from her life. She was mentally feeble, but by god, she was not crazy after all.


    I'm upset, Steve. You can tell, I guess?

    epilogue:

    The strong rule after all. One,thug in particular, did a fine job of hastening Clara Rockmore's death.

    "He betrayed you Clara. He only did that so he can sell your stuff on the internet."

    And you, Steve Sherman, reinforce the lie.
    What unmitigated gall.

    ________


    unproofed draft, composed in composition box, surely rife with typos, rambles, rancor.

    I do not have the stomach to go through all this again.


    and ultimately returned the tape recorder and tape, to this day he has never returned a single photocopied document. In an April 2006 Theremin World post, Reid admitted, “It was very small but exciting consolation to have boxes of fresh Xeroxes of her career's memorabilia. Those boxes remain undisturbed here today.”

    Ammendment

    Ammendment. I took a dose of Pepto and read what I just posted.

    The IPAM has had nine years now to catalog whatever papers they got.

    I won't give the stuff to -you-. No, the better plan is to let the IPAM have the lot of it, and let them sift and collate and see what they did
    -not- get of Clara's archives. I suppose they did not get the Lev letters, nor the schematics, nor a fat envelope of her personal photographs.

    They can make arrangements to pick up these boxes from me at their convenience.
    There's no rush.
    But one addition will be made: Copies of these postings, to go with the record,
    and so, a balance, a weighing of inept and avaricious humans can be added to her record.

    Third entry

    first was "Dialog" (well, that's a mis-title in retrospect)
    second entry, "Ammendment"

    now, for this third entry, at this writing I've finished reading the balance of page one.

    It is so distorted, and seems to try to sew up a story, the making of which result (the destruction of Clara's peace of mind) you yourself were the number two instigator.

    I note that you do not relate that you were an outcast from her life,
    along with the entire family. Only three people had ready access to Clara: Betty, me, Steve and perhaps Dalit's mother; I don't know her.

    I do know that by mediating with Clara to let you in,
    you speedily aided Martin in kicking me out.

    And towards the end, SHE DID take my calls, and we did have several good-toned conversations, weepy and sincere and we
    both made our peace.

    And never did I speak to her a bad word about you or about Steve Martin.

    I was a gentle as a broken feather can touch.
    I did touch her again. But, by then it was too late.

    Thanks for nothing, Sherman. Thanks for airing in excruciating detail your evident 'care' for Martin's rep, by reopening a long fading
    set of memories on all sides.

    Bottom line: I never made things up. I never lie. My name is know on the 'net as a writer, poet, and enemy of public bullies.

    Butter won't melt in your mouth. In my hands, it melts and is gone, as it should be, I suppose.

    I'm sorry to have to call out the truth. What did I ever gain?
    I got to know and love Clara in a kinship you never had.

    Fourth entry

    Steven, you quoted me out of context from this page:

    http://www.thereminworld.com/forum.asp?cmd=p&amp;T=1624&amp;F=1&amp;p=2

    I ask readers to read that page, and see also the sentimental poem
    (I don't call the poem "good", I call it genuine)

    And let anyone, please, who would like to believe your version of the picture, do as they like.

    I think, though, that from the first day I spoke to her,
    I think that I was honest with her. It was her life,
    her memoribilia, her aim to share it freely, so long as
    no-one made a buck from it. She said so in her final interview,

    and I think, in the poem, that the essence comes through,
    that she only wanted what was best for her legacy,
    and best was to be open, share, disseminate.

    I followed her wishes. The practice tape, of which you feign caused "injury", could hurt nothing. It was presented in context,
    and gave a rare chance for thereminists to -just try- to learn to play,
    as if Nadia were there in the next room, and Clara, even closer.

    -----
    The poem again, but see the page for the context.

    (apologies for filling up this page with so much of "me". It's for Clara)

    Self introduction to Clara Rockmore, 1994=

    I met Clara Rockmore by playing intuition
    like she phrased the theremin,
    by changing phases in the air.

    High priestess of that instrument,
    "<em>It's not for schpooky music!</em>",
    she took little contact with a world
    old age, suspicion, shut her in.

    When I'd learned that Clara
    was still alive (though barely),
    a dozen roses teleported

    to her New York City home
    <em>from an anonymous admirer in Miami</em>.

    She was piqued. She could not phone.

    The florist called instead, "A nag
    is pushing for your name and address."

    I looked up Clara, always listed;
    telephoned her then and heard
    her music--myself as her muse.

    "Oh! You're the one who sent these roses?
    They're so lovely, lasting well.
    How did you know red is my color?
    Red roses are my favorite flowers."

    Honesty declaimed— "I guessed".

    "Professor Termin courted me;
    he sent red roses every week.

    That was many years ago.

    Now you send me roses—so
    I must ask, I need to know
    WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?"

    "Nothing, Mrs. Rockmore, nothing but to say
    your music makes my mornings last the entire day.
    I listen to your album
    put down years ago.
    I think you are immortal
    but none of us are so—
    so blessed to have your soul
    and the taste you evidence.

    So I sent some roses as
    reminders of the lives you touch."

    And nearly every-after month
    I'd send a fresh red dozen.

    But, Clara couldn't love

    forever—lost in May of '98.

<p><span style="font-size: small;"><i>The following essay was written by Steve J. Sherman, Clara Rockmore's great-nephew and Nadia Reisenberg's grandson. As the title suggests, it provides us with an in-depth account of Clara Rockmore’s life during her last decade, up until her death in 1998, and includes a detailed chapter devoted to the controversial summer of 1997 and the events that brought an end to the friendship between Clara Rockmore and Reid Welch, the theremin engineer and aficionado.<br />
Thereminvox.com does not take sides in this dispute, but we hope that the publication of this document, originally intended only for the members of the Levnet mailing list, will promote a dialogue between all those involved and, hopefully, further allow for closure.</i> (V.S.)</span></p>
<p>This is my own personal recollection of Clara’s last years, up to her death in May of 1998. As the title suggests, I will also specifically detail the summer of 1997 when the controversy surrounding Reid Welch, our family and Steve Martin took place. And while in any other essay about Clara, I would have relegated the entire Welch saga to maybe a paragraph, if even that, for this particular essay it will be dealt with in depth, as promised to Levnet members. My hope is to finally provide authoritative closure to this episode.</p>
<p>I am motivated in part by the amount of misinformation and disinformation I’ve discovered across the internet and indeed the published spectrum, masquerading as fact yet wrongly representing Clara’s life and story. The dispute between Reid Welch, our family and Steve Martin became a source for much of this speculation and false information; when it went public over the Levnet in 1997, it revealed many private details without proper context or explanation – or in some cases, without basis in reality. Reid continues to discuss his own version of events on various Internet forums to this day, and I truly believe that the resulting distortion of her story would have bothered Clara as much as it does me. I want the record set straight, for it is a record of pride, courage and dignity, and the rumors and false innuendo have no rightful place in this story.</p>
<p>By definition, I can’t very well discuss these last years without revealing certain details of the medical issues and personal tribulations Clara was dealing with during her last three years. A public figure for almost all of her life, Clara was really a very private person who kept details of her personal life close to her and her family. While she confided easily to those she most trusted, she fully expected we would honor her and maintain discretion. During her last few years, Clara chose to isolate herself from much of the public, and even some close friends and relatives – she was very clear that she wanted people to remember her as she had been for her first 84 years, not as she was for the final three. Also, her illness forced her to do things that she was not able to understand, or control. So how to honestly relate what was going on inside her home, mind and life without revealing details she would consider private? This is my greatest quandary in writing this piece.</p>
<p>My primary authority here is that I was there. Of the many nieces and nephews in Clara’s family, I ended up perhaps closest to Clara in her very last years; while ALL of us enjoyed a rich and deep relationship with her throughout our lives, during those last many months, I was one of the few who spent a great deal of time with her and as she became ill, physically cared for her, often daily. My role here was partly due to proximity (my office was 4 blocks from her home, and my home a 15 minute bike ride away) and partly due to our shared professions in the music world. But most of all, we were always close and had a special personal relationship; for Clara, I was “The Little Character”, a nickname bestowed upon me by Clara’s husband Bob when I was a toddler, and one which she lovingly called me ever after.</p>
<p>On Levnet, responding to Howard (“Uncle Howie”) Mossman’s direct question to me of what really happened between Reid and Steve, many people had strong reactions -- some requested that I not “reopen” old wounds while others were thrilled that I would finally set the record straight. Personally, I do not think those old wounds ever closed (I know they have not for Reid and Steve), and therefore do not believe I can re-ignite what is still smoldering. I accept that for some people, I am destined to hurt and offend nonetheless, simply by telling the truth as I witnessed and lived it.</p>
<p>This is the second quandary I face in writing this piece -- how to tell this part of the story honestly, candidly and accurately while remaining fair to all involved, and still somehow provide a measure of closure instead of fanning the flames and unnecessarily adding to the hurt and anger. Is this even possible, or necessary?</p>
<p>My loyalty is unabashedly to Clara, and I will adamantly represent her side of this story, and thus our family’s side. I am aware that I am not a neutral outsider, or a perfect being – I was deeply involved and deeply upset by the events as they unfolded, and try as I will to temper my own personal biases, inevitably something may leak through. Finally, I am also very aware that I am telling this story to Levnet, of whom Reid has been a long time friend and respected member. You have all heard his version of events many times over; for some it’s become woven and inculcated into the accepted history. How will you assimilate and integrate my version where it inevitably veers from what you’ve long been told, and believed?</p>
<p>I can only hope you will hear me out with the same fairness and openness that I am trying to bring to this essay. And I think we will all agree that I am neither judge nor jury – I am a witness, one man who saw what he saw and felt what he felt, yet unable to see into another man’s heart or mind to truly know his inner intent.<br />

<h2 align="left">A Brief Personal Background</h2>
<p>The three Reisenberg sisters, Nadia (born 1904), Anna (Newta), born 1907 and Clara (born 1911), were born in Vilna, Lithuania, grew up in Vilna and St. Petersburg, Russia, and came to New York in 1922. The three sisters were inseparable; each was strong willed, powerful, talented, righteous, politely irreverent, debonair and worldly, and their homes were always full of love, laughter, music, champagne and roses – and all in Russian. Our family was always very close and very strong. All three sisters had brilliant marriages, yet all lost their husbands tragically early – Nadia married Isaac (Sasha) Sherman in 1924 and he died in 1955, Newta married Meir Sherman (Sasha’s nephew) in 1938 and he died in 1970, and Clara married Robert Rockmore in 1933; he died in 1963.</p>
<p>I do not need to tell this audience about Clara’s professional history, from her childhood days as a violin student of Professor Leopold Auer at the St. Petersburg Conservatory to her six decade career as the world’s greatest virtuosa thereminist. I also don’t need to tell this audience about the incredible, even magical, musical relationship that Clara had with her sister and soul mate Nadia, or about Nadia’s own amazing career; certainly, the many recordings still available will attest to that.</p>
<p>In 1928, 17 year old Clara Reisenberg met the Soviet scientist Lev Sergeyevich Termen in New York, and soon began working with him on his electronic instrument, later to be called the theremin. Professor Termen fell madly in love with Clara (and remained in love with her to his dying day), but Clara was also being courted by a dapper, charming and renowned entertainment lawyer and Broadway producer named Robert Rockmore. In 1933, Clara and Bob, very much in love, were married. They led a charmed life; they were music lovers, art collectors, theater benefactors, high society intellectuals and pioneers in the American civil rights movement. Bob included among his many clients and close friends Eugene O’Neill and Paul Robeson, whom Bob represented throughout his career. Clara performed with and toured with Paul in the 1930s and early 1940s, defying and breaking racial barriers across the nation. When Paul had to flee from the Peekskill riots of 1949, he took refuge at our family’s summer compound on Stillwater Lake in New Castle (Ossining township), NY.</p>
<p>Clara was a very proud and dignified person, who cherished love, integrity, honesty, decency, trust and loyalty. She was a hopeless romantic, a happy and spirited woman who delighted in chivalry. She abhorred vulgarity, although was not afraid of it. She had a sharp and highly refined sense of humor, and she was as feisty as she was charming – the life of every party. Clara was petite, and beautiful, and had many admirers. A natural performer, she was a diva who never let you forget it. Well versed in art, literature, languages, politics and of course, music, she had a strong will and was as determined as she was open to alternative. She defied many of her generation by readily accepting and embracing eccentric or alternative lifestyles in others, as long as they were true and honored themselves and those around them.</p>
<p>Clara was completely devastated when her beloved Bob died in early 1963 from head injuries suffered after slipping on ice. Forever more, Clara detested the winter. Clara and Newta were again profoundly saddened by the death of their beloved sister Nadia in 1983. Newta died three months after Clara’s death.<br />
<!--nextpage--></p>
<h2 align="left">JULY 1975 – The Moog Recording</h2>
<p>In July 1975, Robert and Shirleigh Moog came to New York and recorded Clara and Nadia on 5-track audiotape -- in straight takes, they recorded around 30 different compositions. In 1977 twelve of those performances were released as a 33 rpm LP on Delos Records titled “Clara Rockmore, Theremin – ‘premiere artiste’ of the electronic music medium, with Nadia Reisenberg, piano”. This was Clara’s first ever commercially available recording, and for many people worldwide, their first introduction to the theremin.</p>
<h2 align="left">Late 1980’s</h2>
<p>In 1986, Nadia’s two sons, Robert (my father) and Alexander, authored a commemorative book on Nadia’s life entitled “Nadia Reisenberg, A Musician’s Scrapbook”, that coincided with a number of exhibitions on Nadia’s life and work, produced by the family and the International Piano Archives at the University of Maryland (IPAM). Many wonderful photographs and details of Clara’s early life are presented in this book.</p>
<p>In 1987, Delos Records re-released Clara and Nadia’s 1977 LP as a CD entitled “The Art of the Theremin”. Although probably re-recorded from the LP and not re-mastered from the original tapes, this CD nonetheless brought Clara’s artistry to many new listeners, and created new interest in the theremin and Clara herself. Clara was thrilled to finally have her music publicly available on such a level, and her star began to rise again.</p>
<p>In 1989, IPAM records released a 2 CD set from prior recordings entitled “Nadia Reisenberg; An Album of Chamber Music”, which included 3 pieces from the Moog recording sessions of Clara and Nadia that were not included on the Delos recording (but would re-surface 17 years later on “Clara Rockmore’s Lost Theremin Album”, along with 13 previously unreleased tracks, all beautifully re-mastered).</p>
<p>In January of 1989, Steven M. Martin, a filmmaker, met Clara for the first time. Trying to get Clara to perform the music for a film he wanted to make, she politely but firmly refused, telling him that she was retired from the stage. Steve continued to visit Clara and they struck up a friendship, but she continued to refuse his film idea. Clara told Steve her life story and the history of the instrument, and she played for him -- he was mesmerized. He abandoned the original film idea he had approached Clara about in the first place, and declared his intent to make a film about Clara, Leon Theremin and the instrument they shared in common. Clara, whose life mission was the furtherance of the theremin, was flattered, but demurred nonetheless, saying that her instrument was no longer working properly. “What if I can get it fixed for you, will you then let me film you?” he asked.</p>
<p>That same year, in conjunction with Nadia’s chamber music CD release, our family began planning a tribute concert to Nadia Reisenberg to be held that September in NY’s Merkin Concert Hall. When Dad asked Clara to play, she again insisted that she was retired from the stage, but “for Nadia I would do anything”. Now she had a double incentive to get her instrument fixed, and Steve Martin arranged (and paid for) Clara’s friend and admirer Robert Moog to come up to NY. Bob Moog, along with Clara’s long time NY engineer Mike Jasen, rebuilt her theremin over the course of a weekend, bringing it into solid working condition. Clara was thrilled – as Bob Moog described it, when they finally got it working just right, Clara played “Summertime” and at its end, turned to them with tears in her eyes, and said “I thought I would never play this instrument again.”</p>
<p>Clara prepared with pianist Morey Ritt, a former student of Nadia’s and Professor of Piano and Music at Queens College. Clara was keenly aware that this would be her first public concert in many years, and her first since her beloved Nadia had died, and therefore she was all the more reluctant to be filmed, but Steve was very persuasive in a gentlemanly but honest and direct manner, and promised her that he would do a “good job”.</p>
<p>Steve Martin arranged to film during the rehearsal on the afternoon of September 28, 1989, in the hours prior to the concert. That morning, I remember helping my dad and Mike Jasen (Bob Moog was not able to return to NY for the concert) take the theremin and speaker apart, wrapping them in blankets, and taking them down to Dad’s car for the 10 block ride up to 67th St. with Clara worriedly watching our every move. Once on stage, set up and turned on, the instrument was erratic -- Clara’s cries of “Where’s Mike?” caused us to hold our breath as Mike sweated to adjust the instrument to Clara’s satisfaction. Finally, it was ready; I picked up my cameras, which Clara was used to, and Steve’s crew of at least 6 people and 2 cameras jumped to life and moved in, which immediately made Clara nervous. Shooing away the cameramen and establishing a no-mans zone around her, she began playing (this scene opens Martin’s film). The sound was glorious, and she soon forgot about all the people on stage; when we saw that familiar “Clara trance” take hold, we all settled in for a brilliant and beautiful performance. Clara was playing for Nadia – there was not a dry eye in that hall, including her own.</p>
<p>That night’s concert, “Nadia Reisenberg, A Joyful Remembrance”, was an incredibly moving and gratifying experience. Hosted by my father, performers/speakers included Alexander (Sasha) Schneider, Artur Balsam, Richard Goode, Rudolf Firkusny, David Glazer, Earl Carlyss, Joel Krosnick, Ann Schein, Nadia’s child student Dalit Warshaw and her mom Ruti Warshaw), and of course, Clara with Morey Ritt. The music throughout was superb, the reminiscences warm and poignant, and Clara’s presence was spellbinding. It was to be her last public performance.</p>
<p>In the months following, Steve Martin began to work feverishly on the Theremin film, and naturally, spent a lot of time with Clara. With his cocky yet honest and straight shooting attitude, his quirky sense of humor, and his dark but visionary intellect, they grew very close and eventually Steve became a regular part of Clara’s life. In her final years, he was one of the few who had virtually unrestricted access to Clara – he was always there for her, willing to come out at any hour of the day or night for whatever she needed, and by the end, was perhaps her closest non-family friend and confidant.<br />

<h2 align="left">1990 to 1996.</h2>
<p>The release of the Delos LP “The Art of the Theremin”, and later its’ release on CD (1987), introduced an entirely new generation to her artistry. These were renaissance years -- Clara was delighted and exhilarated with such a resurgence in her career and rekindled interest in the theremin “for the right reasons”.</p>
<p>In October of 1991, just prior to the fall of the Soviet Union but after all travel restrictions had been eased, Lev Sergeyevitch Termen came to America for the much anticipated reunion with Clara. While Clara and Bob Rockmore had visited him clandestinely in Moscow in 1962 (they met in a metro station to avoid detection), and while I and family members had visited him in Moscow in 1985 and again in 1987, this was the first time he had been back to America since 1938. Steve Martin arranged this visit with help from John Chowning, head of the electronic music department at the University of Stanford; after a week in California, Steve brought Termen to NY, knowing how much this would mean for Clara and Lev, and for his film. True to her nature, Clara welcomed Lev Termen into her apartment yet quickly kicked Steve and his cameramen out, preferring the privacy of a long-overdue reunion. In the film, this is Clara’s famous unscripted line “CUT!”</p>
<p>An unfinished version of the film “Theremin; An Electronic Odyssey” premiered on Channel 4 in Great Britain on November 3, 1993; ironically, that same night Lev Sergeyevich Termen died at the age of 97. He never saw the film that carried his name.</p>
<p>In 1994, Steve Martin premiered the final version of his film to critical acclaim; it quickly hit the charts, gathered accolades and generated quite a buzz. At the Sundance Festival, it won the Filmmaker’s Trophy for best documentary. Steve took it to the Berlin, Munich, Vienna and St. Petersburg Film Festivals, among others, and then was invited to show it at the famed NY Film Festival. Nominated for a British Academy Award, Clara could not have been more proud, and while she teased Steve about “our” movie, always was quick to praise him and give full credit and honor for the job he did. In fact, after showing the film at the NY Film Festival in October, Steve invited Clara up on stage and she received such a long, raucous and jubilant standing ovation that she would later speak about this as one of the greatest moments in her life.</p>
<p>Between “The Art of the Theremin” and “Theremin; An Electronic Odyssey”, Clara was once again an international celebrity. Her phone was ringing off the hook, media were clamoring for interviews, and offers to perform were coming in from around the globe (for example, Tomita, world renowned electronic music composer and performer, wanted to bring Clara to Japan for joint performances and recordings). Clara, while thrilled with the surge of interest in her instrument and her musicianship, was in the unenviable position of needing to balance all of this with her own personal life and needs for some sanity and privacy. Needless to say, she handled it like a pro -- she granted many interviews, refused all offers to concertize, and marveled at the whole thing. Without a secretary or assistant, she would often call me, Dad or one of our family members, or even Steve Martin, to come for tea or to accompany a news crew, meaning that someone she didn’t know was coming over for the first time and she wanted one of us to be there. Other times, she would ask us (and especially Steve) to handle her correspondence when she didn’t have the time or energy to respond.</p>
<p>In June of 1994 I married Dorothy Lawson, a superb cellist in whom Clara found a deep and fulfilling kindred spirit. Clara referred to Dorothy as a true musician who “gets it” and has the chops to prove it. Clara, who always stayed current with details of my love life, was thrilled that I had (finally) found a truly wonderful and beautiful life-mate “whom we both loved”, and the two of them developed a real affinity for each other. Clara would later credit Dorothy with saving her life, and she meant it most literally.</p>
<p>That same summer, Reid Welch entered Clara’s life. A piano tuner by profession, and an amateur thereminist (and accomplished electrical technician), Reid anonymously sent Clara a dozen red roses “from an admirer in Miami”, and when she contacted the florist to try to thank her admirer, Reid was given her number and called her (she was, by the way, always listed in the NYC phone book). They had a number of conversations, more flowers were sent, and Reid finally came to NY and met Clara in December of 1994. He was a charming, suave and generous person, and he offered to tune her piano for free. She enjoyed his gifts and his warm style, his doting attention and clear desire to get closer to her, and he soon won her friendship. Living in Florida, Reid was only in NY periodically and mostly stayed in contact by phone and mail. We the family were delighted, and Reid went on to become a trusted friend and Clara looked forward to his letters, calls and visits.</p>
<p>Of the many people who called with renewed interest in Clara, one was most poignant. In October 1994, I got a call from David Harrington, first violinist of the Kronos Quartet – he had just learned that Clara was my aunt, and wanted very much to meet her. He had been introduced to her music when his teenage son Adam, who was fascinated by the theremin, gave him Clara’s Delos recording. David said that while he was curious about and intrigued by the instrument, he was totally swept off his feet by her musicianship. In her playing, he heard the most magnificent violin playing he ever heard – phrasing, breathing, bowings, things he had not heard from any living master, and yet would most want to emulate in his own playing. For Clara, these were the “right reasons” to appreciate her music, and the three of us had a wonderful tea at her home. As she often did when she really liked and respected someone, she played for him and he came away smitten. We talked at length; he wanted to produce her Lost Album, wanted to get her music out there and had all sorts of ideas that we began discussing in earnest, but that was not to be, as personal tragedy was to strike them both in the spring of 1995.</p>
<p>For David, it was Adam’s sudden death at age 16 from a coronary thrombosis, and for Clara, it was a bout of pneumonia that became so severe that on March 7. 1995, just two days before her birthday, she was taken to Beth Israel North Hospital. Clara hated hospitals with a passion, and had long ago made me promise that I would NEVER let her die in one. Unfortunately, Clara was put into a double room with a cancer patient in her last hours of life, wheezing and moaning and gasping for air. Clara was freaked. I immediately went to the admissions office and with checkbook in hand, asked for her to be transferred immediately to a private room. I was told there were no rooms available – I did not accept this, knowing they always have rooms set aside for VIPS, and informed them that Clara was just such a VIP. Finally I was able to get Clara assigned to a private room but before she could be moved, she suffered a heart attack -- congestive heart failure almost killed her. She was put into the ICU – and when her condition stabilized a few days hence, she was moved to a private room. Her doctor said she had suffered substantial damage to her heart, and was still battling pneumonia.</p>
<p>In the days following, we visited Clara daily. She was quite scared by her close brush with death, and became increasingly agitated about the indignities of hospital life. A certain medication she was given altered her taste buds and made everything taste bitter, or salty – and she stopped eating. She hated the callous treatment she was getting, and found the whole experience humiliating and depressing. Following an accident in which she was hit in the head by a heavy metal bar while being weighed, she just gave up and stopped fighting. We would come see her, and she would lie unresponsive in her bed, eyes closed, limp and not moving, her skin grey and her breathing labored. We would plead with her to fight, that she should be able to go home soon, that this was not her time to go, but all to no avail. I reminded her of my promise to never let her die in a hospital and told her I would forcibly remove her and take her back home if necessary – no response.</p>
<p>My wife Dorothy had an idea, and we brought a boom box into Clara’s room. Setting it on her bed (Clara’s tiny frame left plenty of room at the foot of her bed), Dorothy began playing one of Clara’s favorite chamber works, the Tchaikovsky Trio, in a version Dorothy had just recorded. Just minutes into the first movement, we literally watched in awe as color began to come back into Clara’s face. Her right hand began tapping the rhythm, then air conducting, then she was humming along, and soon her eyes were open. It wasn’t long before she was smiling, and commenting on a passage or remarking about a particularly good phrasing, as if nothing at all had changed in her life. At the end of the trio, she let tears run as she said, pointing to the boom box, “This is my life, not this” as she waved her hand at the room. She hugged us, and by that evening, was already looking forward to going home. She did so less than a week and a half later, telling everyone who would listen that Dorothy and Tchaikovsky had saved her life. I remember as I helped her from her car and escorted her back into her apartment, she hugged me and quipped that I had indeed kept my promise to her. I thought she had forgotten…</p>
<p>But her life would never be the same again. Her heart was weakened, and she required bed rest daily, constant medications and daily home care. Her taste buds were forever changed, and she became malnourished – not that hard for someone who never reached the weight of 100 lbs. a single day in her life. Betty Baldwin became her head nurse and trusted companion – Betty was with Clara on a daily basis, managed her domestic needs and medical schedule, and would remain with and devoted to Clara until the end.</p>
<p>Clara, determined to reclaim normalcy, struggled on; by mid summer, my wife and I were able to resume our tradition of taking Clara to a Sunday Champagne brunch at a local eatery, and by the end of the summer, she was strong enough to make the one hour trip to Ossining to attend Newta’s 90th Birthday. In November she traveled to Caramoor, former homestead of Lucy Bigelow Rosen, for the Theremania Festival; she was in fine form as the honored guest on a dais that included her dear friends Bob Moog and Steve Martin, and moderated by my dad. This was her return to some semblance of normal life.</p>
<p>Clara, never a fan of the medical profession but even less a fan of pain and discomfort, closely followed her doctor’s advice and tried to force food down, but as the year ended, her weakened heart and undernourished body (which also weakened her teeth and bones) began to take a further toll on her. There are still conflicting medical theories about whether or not she suffered from a series of mini-strokes; often virtually undetectable but widely known to effect people in adverse ways, altering personalities, changing moods, and affecting a person’s sense of self. I watched these mini-strokes wreak havoc on my maternal grandmother (Bronia Gershuni) and her personality, and saw many of the same signs in Clara -- although it was never diagnosed.</p>
<p>With full time nursing care, lovingly headed up by Betty, Clara was comfortable and well cared for, but she struggled with demons she could not properly identify, understand or control. At times she would become fearful and angry, even paranoid – how dare this whatever it was change who she was, and force her to act like someone she didn’t recognize. At other times, she was her normal self. Unable to control it, and unsure how she would come across to people at any given time, she began to shut her door and soon was isolating herself from everyone except family and close friends, so that, in her paraphrased words, “people will remember me as I was, not as I’ve become”.</p>
<p>Following the success of Steve Martin’s movie, he began working to create a Hollywood feature film based upon the lives of Lev Sergeyevich and Clara, and on January 30, 1996, Clara signed an agreement with Sony assigning all rights to license her name, image and likeness for commercial exploitation – a prerequisite for major studios before they consider your material. Clara was still in relatively fine shape on good days, and struggling through bad days, but for the most part able to continue with our Champagne brunches and visits from family and close friends. While some days she would stay in bed, other days she would move freely around her apartment, or even take short walks outside or sit in the lovely garden in her building’s courtyard.</p>
<p>On July 31, 1996, she allowed me to bring a photographer, Chris Kahley, over for tea. Earlier, he had called me asking permission to photograph her. He was genuine and respectful, and I agreed to put them in touch while telling him not to get his hopes up. Yet he was so sweet to her on the phone, that to my delight (and surprise) she not only said yes, but she dressed up and put on makeup. She was completely her old radiant self that afternoon – telling stories and serving the tea herself, shooing away a delighted but cautious Betty. Not wanting to step on Chris’ toes, but unable to contain myself, I too took out my camera and photographed her that day – one of these images is included on page 3 of the “Lost Album” CD booklet.</p>
<p>Yet this period saw some sad episodes as well, and the family too fell victim to nerves and her mood swings – Clara would sometimes turn on family members as well as outsiders, and even her relationship with her beloved sister Newta began to show signs of strain. Newta was often asking me to come by and pick up bags of homemade food to deliver to Clara, all of her traditional favorites, yet Clara’s taste had changed so that it did not help and she could not eat much of it. For many reasons, nerves began to fray and other rifts threatened to open in the family. Clara tried so hard to control her moods, being aware of and not liking who she had become when under their spell. Some days she just didn’t want to see anyone, and she isolated herself more and more, once or twice refusing even me.<br />

<h2 align="left">The Summer of 1997</h2>
<p>1997 was a very difficult year, even before the summer’s events. Clara’s health was noticeably deteriorating; on good days, she could get out of bed and seem like herself, albeit an exhausted self. On other days, she would stay in bed, unable to get up. Painfully aware of her “other side”, she would openly speak to me about her constant struggle to maintain her own personality. She became increasingly afraid of and disturbed by, even angry at, what was happening to her, and felt helpless to forestall the bad days.</p>
<p>In March, the family gathered to celebrate Clara’s 86th birthday at Newta’s apartment, a big deal as Clara wasn’t going out much anymore and Newta wasn’t throwing as many parties anymore (her health was also slowly deteriorating). Newta was (gratefully) stubborn and never gave up, and insisted we all gather for the party, whether or not Clara would be well enough to attend. To our delight, Clara was in good shape that day and did attend, and it was a truly wonderful afternoon. But this was the uncertainty we lived with – Clara’s situation changed day to day, and it was clear that she was slowly losing her battle. It was during this summer of 1997 that the most unfortunate controversy with Reid Welch occurred.</p>
<p>This conflict was really a series of multi-layered events, beginning with Reid’s July visit with Clara and coming to a head in August and September. While many speak of the conflict as one between Reid and Steve Martin, and certainly some of it became that, it would more accurately be characterized as a reaction by Steve, our family, and ultimately Clara, to certain actions taken by Reid.</p>
<p>Reid Welch and Steve Martin occupied very separate and distinct places in Clara’s life, yet shared one important commonality – they were both non-family members who approached Clara with reverence and love, won her friendship and trust, and entered her inner circle. Steve of course had an 8 year track record of professional loyalty and personal devotion. Reid was by his own account “the newcomer”, welcomed in for his warm sincerity and camaraderie.</p>
<p>I was friendly and on good terms with both Steve and Reid, although much closer with Steve, and certainly trusted each of them with Clara. In fact, if there was ever any friction between them, it was mitigated by the fact that Reid and Steve never really crossed paths that much -- as I said, Reid was not around that much. He would come up to visit periodically from Florida, and when he did, both Steve and I would back off to make room for them – or take a needed break, while Clara engaged with him. And when he left, we would step back in to our customary places as her primary companions and house groupies (only Betty and her cadre of nurses were there 24/7, then came us, and then certain other family members came and went, depending upon Clara’s mood).</p>
<p>On June 12, 1997, Reid passed through NY on his way to the 1st International Theremin Festival in Portland, Maine, and Clara was in good shape and happy to see her friend. He made a tape recording of Clara offering a greeting to the Maine Festival, which we (the family) thought was a lovely gesture. She was so devoted to getting the word out to theremin enthusiasts, and understood the power of her. She was delighted to be able to send this greeting, and I understand it was warmly received at the Festival (at which Steve was a speaker).</p>
<p>Following the Festival, Steve went off to California, sowing seeds for his Hollywood film, while Reid traveled around a bit before returning to NYC in early July, where he spent a week visiting Clara on a daily basis. Unfortunately, Clara was in markedly worse condition than she had been in June, and spending entire days in bed. Even in this condition, she was happy to have Reid visiting and did her best to welcome him back into her home. We too thought this was a very good thing – it helped her perk up.</p>
<p>During one of these visits, Reid asked her if he could interview her at length, and Clara was happy to acquiesce. She was determined to do whatever she could in supporting both the instrument and her legacy – as she said during this interview, “I don’t have that much time to live, so I’m not going to waste my time”.</p>
<p>From her first words on the tape, one can hear that she is not quite herself -- her voice is measured, and some disorientation is evident. Having given interviews for decades, she was known to be an elegant and intelligent speaker, able to draw from those many years of interview experience to provide specific answers and well-worn stories by rote -- yet for Reid’s microphone we hear her searching for words, repeating a story about Leopold Auer taking her to see Menuhin (the second time, confusing Josef Hofmann for Auer, but catching herself at the punch-line), and getting confused over a question about Curtis (where Nadia studied). On this tape, she is clearly not herself. After 18 minutes, she became too tired to continue and had to stop.</p>
<p>That said, the interview was a warm, sincere and courageous effort on her part, and there is much about it that is wonderful to hear, especially the moments when the “old Clara” shines through. And while not the definitive Clara as she would have wanted to be remembered, Clara’s own request about the interview was clear. As she ended the interview, tired and struggling for the right words, she still exuded her vintage self and her sentiments for her colleagues and for the future as she answers Reid’s question of what she wants him to do with this tape:</p>
<blockquote><p>“What I want you to do with this tape is, it’s all given from me with my whole heart for use for people; it’s not to be reserved like a museum piece. I want it to be put into use, I want people to be able to, to benefit by it, to play, to do something further and to help other people. It’s all free, free, free, free, no price is expected and no money and no compensation is expected except to benefit people who will have the sensitivity to listen to it… It’s all given with my full heart. I want to leave something tangibly good to follow in my footsteps.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Over the years, Clara had carefully collected and kept her professional and personal documents, her archive, in various living room cabinets and her living room closet. Containing legal contracts, deeds and wills, technical diagrams, old concert programs, publicity photos, extra tubes, letters, autographs, and personal materials. Clara’s archives were always meticulously kept safe and secure. I personally looked inside those cabinets maybe a handful of times in my life, although certain family members, including my father and uncle, had worked with Clara on various business matters, on researching for publications or just putting things in order. As far as I know, Bob Moog, Mike Jasen and Steve Martin were the only non-family members ever invited to look into the archives with her, seeking specific documents, and each went in with a healthy Clara at his side. Clara knew the value of this material, and protected her archive accordingly; after all, she had been married to a lawyer for 30 years…</p>
<p>During the summer of 1997, we entered negotiations with the International Piano Archives of University of Maryland (IPAM) to contractually bequeath Clara’s entire archive to them, as we had done with Nadia’s archives. So it was at this most sensitive time that Reid involved himself in Clara’s archives, and thus set into motion the events that would ultimately bring his relationship with Clara to an end.</p>
<p>Reid has written that during a phone call prior to his visit, Clara had invited him to photocopy her instrument’s schematic (Clara did not recall this). Reid’s July visit with Clara offered him such an opportunity, and again according to Reid’s account, he and Clara went through her closet, presumably looking for the schematic (such documents were not kept in the closet). In the closet, they found her old violins, and a reel to reel tape recorder and an old tape reel. According to Reid, Clara was unsure what was on the tape and suggested they just throw it out; Reid assured her he could both fix the tape recorder and find out for her what was on the tape, and she agreed to allow him to take these things home with him to do so.</p>
<p>Later, when we learned of this, we appreciated Reid’s gracious offer to fix Clara’s tape machine and find out what was on the tape (although Clara would never have suggested they throw the tape out). We had no reason not to believe Reid’s account that she accompanied him into the closet, and gave her permission for him to borrow these specific items for the reasons stated. Clara herself didn’t remember.</p>
<p>However, after going through her closet, Reid continued to look through her materials; Betty reported that Clara retired back to her bed, and Reid began looking inside her living room cabinets where she kept all her personal and professional papers and documents. Over the course of the next few days, Reid then carted out boxes and boxes of her private papers and original documents, and proceeded to photocopy over a thousand of them. In an April 2006 posting on Theremin World, he said, “To my disappointment, after sifting through and copying a thousand pieces of historical paper, there was no primary schematic to be found… I copied so much else, for sound reasons, in multiple runs to the copying shop across the street from #357 W. 57th.” (Note – for the record, Clara’s address was 350 W. 57th St).</p>
<p>Reid has written that he had Clara’s explicit permission to look through and photocopy her complete archives. While it’s always possible that he misunderstood her and/or she him, and it’s also possible she did in fact give him permission to photocopy the schematic, it is very unlikely (and would have been totally uncharacteristic of her) that she granted any such permission for her full archive. While she would have been wary of anyone photocopying all her papers, she never would have allowed anyone to remove her archives from her home.</p>
<p>Betty, who was the only eye witness to this event, was a consummate professional – she strongly felt that it was not her place to meddle in Ms. Rockmore’s affairs or second guess Ms. Rockmore’s guests, but equally sensed that something was very wrong here and called me to quietly and privately express her concerns over what Reid was doing. Betty told me that Clara was in bed during this time, and while aware of Reid’s presence, was completely unaware of what he was doing or what was happening in her living room with her archive.</p>
<p>Adding another twist, there’s also a distinct possibility that Clara thought Reid was Steve Martin’s brother Doug -- when Steve returned from LA, Clara told him that his brother had been in her home.</p>
<p>All we know as fact is that Clara was elderly and ill, and that Reid, fully aware of the historical value of her archives, removed and copied thousands of Clara’s private and professional documents without recognized permission, and without informing anyone in the family of what he was doing or to confirm his right to do it.</p>
<p>Needless to say, my family was very concerned. I immediately contacted Reid and asked him to meet me for lunch, which we did on July 12. I told him he must put an immediate stop to this; that these materials belong to Clara, and it was completely unacceptable that anyone would remove anything from her premises, let alone make photocopies, without written legal authority. He insisted that Clara had given him permission to do this, and said he was just doing Clara’s bidding. I told him that we have serious doubts that she knowingly gave such permission, but that even if she did, why did he not at least alert us to what he was preparing to do, or even request that a family member work with him, if for no other reason than to avoid the inevitable perceptions of impropriety or even opening himself up to potential legal trouble. I suggested that he was not qualified to judge her state of mind, and therefore showed extremely poor judgment.</p>
<p>In this lunch, and subsequently in numerous phone conversations, I demanded that he immediately return all original and copied materials – I was not inviting any negotiation or discussion on this matter. Within the next few days, Reid did return some original materials to Clara’s home, and at least two large boxes of original documents and photos directly to my office. He also agreed to return the photocopied documents, and the original tape recorder and Nadia’s practice tape.</p>
<p>With this pledge of cooperation, we were willing at the time to accept that this was a misunderstanding, and quell our doubts about Reid’s integrity and motives – maybe he was simply over-excited to be inside Clara’s world, and had naively interpreted Clara’s wishes vis-à-vis the tape machine and the schematic in an overly broad manner to include other parts of her archive, and that his actions, while foolish, were not malicious.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we don’t think that today. While Reid returned most (although almost certainly not all) of the original documents, and ultimately returned the tape recorder and tape, to this day he has never returned a single photocopied document. In an April 2006 Theremin World post, Reid admitted, “It was very small but exciting consolation to have boxes of fresh Xeroxes of her career's memorabilia. Those boxes remain undisturbed here today.”</p>
<p>Further raising eyebrows in the family, during this visit Reid made a number of comments to various members of our family, and Betty, casting aspersions about Steve. Ironically, Reid informed us that Steve had “dipped into” Clara’s archives and accused him of taking a lot of her papers. Clearly designed to denigrate Steve’s standing with us, they had the opposite reaction as we began to wonder what Reid was really up to.</p>
<p>Reid also asked the family about the disposition of Clara’s theremin, and to find out if there might be some way to obtain or even buy the rights to this instrument from Dalit Warshaw or the family (one of the documents he presumably photocopied was her will, which bequeathed her primary theremin to Dalit). He suggested, naively and incorrectly, that Clara wanted her theremin left to the IPAM archive; he wrote that she, “being of forgetful mind at the end, and often confused as to details, had never updated her will”. Quite the contrary, Clara was always very clear on the details of her will – the family had discussed this with her many times over the years, and during this very period, she had given Dad numerous handwritten instructions for things not specifically included in the will; documentations about her violins, even evaluations of her own recordings. We therefore dismissed Reid’s inappropriate contention and dispelled any further discussion of Clara’s Theremin or her will.</p>
<p>By mid July, Reid was back in Florida, Steve was back in NY, and we the family were trying to figure out what had happened and reconstruct the archive (and determine what was still missing). Steve, having been informed of what happened in his absence, entered the fray with unapologetic anger; he was furious at Reid for taking advantage of Clara. Reid, in turn, blamed Steve for standing in between him and Clara and deliberately poisoning his well, and the friendship between the two evaporated in recriminations.</p>
<p>Steve told Clara about some of what Reid had said and done, and needless to say, Clara was very upset. When I told Steve how angry I was that he had done that, he told me he also told Clara that he had exaggerated, that this had apparently been a misunderstanding, and that Reid was still the same loving self. He told her that Reid would probably write to her to “apologize”, and she seemed satisfied with this. Steve then told Reid that she was expecting such a letter.</p>
<p>None of this was helpful to me -- I was trying very hard to get Reid to return the materials and cooperate with us, while still trying to allow Reid to save face and specifically shield him from assertions of misconduct or theft, words being used by some of my family members to describe what had happened.</p>
<p>In late July, Reid started sending out cassette tapes of the “Clara Rockmore Gift Tape” as he called it; the Clara interview on side A and the contents of the reel-to-reel tape he had found in Clara’s closet on side B -- a practice tape that Nadia had privately made for Clara, just the piano parts to aid Clara when practicing.</p>
<p>Even on the heels of the archive photocopying, the family did not have a problem with the Side A interview – we did not have an issue with Reid making it or distributing it as Clara herself requested (Reid sent me a copy as well). Steve Martin, however, did have a problem with the interview and it’s dissemination, because he felt it was in potential violation of the terms of the Sony agreement of 1996 (of which Clara and he were both signatories), and was concerned that the release of this interview tape so soon after that agreement was ratified could cause Sony to declare Clara in breach of the agreement. He voiced this directly to Reid, as well as to us.</p>
<p>At that time, the family’s position was that any agreement Clara signed must be upheld, that Steve was within his rights to protect the integrity of this agreement, and we urged Steve to seek legal counsel to verify if his concerns were well founded.</p>
<p>However, the family did have a problem with Reid putting the Nadia Reisenberg practice tape on the flip side of the cassette he was sending out. In introducing this tape, Reid narrated the following introduction, inadvertently admitting to the very reasons this was a problem for the family...</p>
<blockquote><p>“Going through her archives, well, while digging through the contents of her living room closet, I found an ancient tape recorder – a Brush Soundmirror from c.1950. This machine hasn’t been used in so many years that Clara didn’t really remember it and she said, Well, maybe we should throw it out. And I said, no no on no. I can, can fix this thing – I know about electronics, and maybe there is something on the tape, maybe you or maybe, ah, your sister. And she said Nadia? Nadia, yes, Nadia could be on this tape. Can you fix it? And I said, well, I’ll take it home if you don’t mind, and she said Please do. So I brought the machine home, and I fixed it the other day, and I made a dub of the contents of the tape. It is entirely Nadia Reisenberg, but, ah, it was designed for Clara to play along with. In other words, it’s the piano portion of these, ah, theremin and piano duets with which we are all familiar, so if you have a theremin and you play as well as Clara Rockmore, you can use the tape as, ah, practice material. Like I say, it was made on an ancient tape recorder with a very primitive microphone, so there’s a good deal of distortion in it, ah, however it is, ah, I think a charming document and I hope you all enjoy it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>From his own words, we know that Reid understood the contents of this practice tape and what it was intended for, that Clara did not know what was on the tape, and that Reid never went back to Clara or the family after discovering what was on it and asking anyone’s permission to copy and/or distribute it -- his distribution was without consent or authorization.</p>
<p>We drew the line, morally and legally, when Reid took it upon himself to distribute Nadia’s practice tape. The family, as well as the Nadia Reisenberg Archives at IPAM, was adamant and resolute that this practice tape not be distributed – it was our private family’s domain, and never intended by either Nadia or Clara to be made public, lest it inadvertently damage Nadia’s legacy and become a bootleg (and a bad one at that) at a time we were re-releasing many of her recordings in anticipation of her centennial.</p>
<p>So in early August, I, on behalf of the family, asked Reid to immediately stop distributing this B side Nadia tape, and to collect any tapes he has sent out – the infamous “recall”. I was very clear that the family was only contesting the B-side, and that while we didn’t actually expect all the tapes to come back (or not be copied by recipients), we were nonetheless giving legal notice. However, with the additional concerns Steve raised concerning the interview, and given what had transpired with the archive, we were very willing to have the entire tape recalled until further legal clarification – for most of our family, patience with Reid was running out.</p>
<p>Steve contacted Reid separately and told him in no uncertain terms that the Clara interview was in violation of his Sony agreement, and must also not be distributed. Reid agreed to cooperate; he asked for both Steve and my input as to how to properly word the recall of the tape, and asked for some sort of proof of Steve’s legal agreement. I sent him a full statement to put out, but Steve did not respond. Consequently, Reid accepted his obligation to recall the Nadia portion of the tape, but announced his intention to continue to distribute the interview.</p>
<p>According to one of Reid’s Levnet postings, Clara then called him on August 3rd saying “I made a mistake. We must not hurt Steve’s Hollywood movie. Promise me you will do whatever he says”. Reid then agreed to stop distributing either portion of the tape, and although we never received any of the tapes back, we were satisfied that at least this specific incident was concluded satisfactorily.</p>
<p>At this point, Reid had gone public on the Levnet, and Steve responded in kind. Back and forth, the accusations and recriminations played out with soap-operatic fury. Details of Clara’s private condition suddenly became public, but not in context or in a dignified manner.</p>
<p>Even so, Reid and I managed to maintain a respectful dialogue. Responding to previous emails and defending himself point by point, Reid emailed me on August 5, “I am a newcomer in Clara’s life. In some ways this presents an awkward situation.” I responded on August 6, “This is true, maybe more than you realized. However, you must understand how this situation presented itself to us – put yourself in our shoes for a moment, and see if you can’t understand why you raised some eyebrows in the family. You came in and spent a few days with Clara. During this time, you expressed concerns to a number of family members about Steve (he has been there for Clara for 10 years now, and has earned a special place in her heart and in ours) and then proceeded to photocopy most of her archival and confidential papers and even take a few items home, which then were distributed publicly. Reid – Clara is 87 and not well. Her papers are historically important and valuable. How would you feel about this if you were in our shoes? How did you expect us to react? These are the things I meant when I said that you used bad judgment.”</p>
<p>On August 5, I wrote a private letter to Reid and Steve in which I scolded both for their harsh and flagrant accusations against the other, and demanded that they stop. I reminded them of the important place each holds in Clara’s life, and the contributions they had made to Clara’s happiness. I said that this “stupid feud” was getting out of hand, and that they must “not say anything to Clara that might turn her against the other in any way, and you must both recognize that her health and other concerns outweigh ALL of our individual needs, careers and egos. She must never be placed in the middle of any dispute, feud or argument.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, by this time, Steve had already discussed the archive situation with Clara, who then sought confirmation and additional details from both Betty and me. We had no choice – we told her exactly what we knew. Clara felt betrayed by Reid, and felt her trust and friendship had been violated. Reid wrote letters to her, defending and explaining his position, expressing his love for her, even apologizing, but to no avail; Clara left a message on his phone machine saying “I will never forgive you for making me betray the trust that Professor Termen gave to me. I will never trust you or your judgment again”. To me personally, she said she never wanted Reid to step foot in her house again; after one of Reid’s letters that she felt was notably inappropriate, I watched her refuse to open any more of his letters.</p>
<p>As Reid sadly and bitterly understood (and posted all over Levnet), his friendship with Clara was over.</p>
<p>Ironically, it was also on August 5 when I informed Clara that we had just reached a deal with IPAM, and the Archive people asked us to begin organizing and cataloguing the archive items. Clara responded by ignoring the raging controversy and wrote me a few pages of notes on half size yellow legal pads with some specific instructions and some general thoughts. She ended by saying, “Needless to say, I am proud and greatly comforted, now in my old age of 87, in knowing that Nadia and Clara will be together forever.”<br />

<h2 align="left">Closure</h2>
<p>So how to turn this unfortunate last chapter into closure?? Maybe Clara herself gave us the answer in that last quote – choosing to look positively ahead rather than dwell on the obvious negativity swirling around her.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that Clara led a brilliant life and was always surrounded by good and loving family and friends. And while this controversy hurt and saddened her, it did not change her life’s trajectory or diminish what was in her heart. She was so much bigger than that.</p>
<p>It is now almost 10 years later. The wounds are still open. Steve feels his professional reputation was irreparably damaged by Reid and the Levnet mob, and Reid feels that Clara’s trust was stolen from him by Steve.</p>
<p>At the time, I had wanted to believe that Reid was acting in what he thought were Clara’s best interests, and was just misguided in overstepping some fundamental civil boundaries. But frankly, Reid himself never allowed me to honestly arrive at that belief -- for one thing, Reid never did return any of the photocopies, and some in the family have doubts that he returned all the original materials.</p>
<p>For another, Reid has continued to go public with his anger and grief. As recently as April 2006, Reid posted dramatic writings on public Internet forums (Theremin World, CriticalPoet.com, etc.) that exaggerate his own role in Clara’s life, diminish and misrepresent our family’s role during those years, further denigrate Steve, and at times even invade Clara’s privacy. Much of what he wrote is sweet and forlorn, but some is downright misleading, angry and inappropriate. It was largely due to these recent postings that I agreed to write this essay.</p>
<p>Reid did much that was good for Clara and gave her many hours of joy. Nothing can ever take that away from him, and regardless of how this ended, I remain grateful to him for the good he did, and hope that this means as much to him now as it did to Clara then. I also remain eternally grateful to everything that Steve did for Clara and for our family during what was a difficult and painful time. Steve was consistently there for Clara in ways that no one who was not there could ever comprehend -- theirs was a true friendship of the purest order.</p>
<p>I have told this story in as fair, candid, honest and accurate a manner as I can, upholding Clara’s and my own standards for integrity and truth. I offer this with deep love and enduring respect for Clara. While I welcome any response to my words, I cannot promise that I will engage in further dialogue. I have said my piece, and accept that this chapter is over and it’s time to move on.</p>
<p>With our release of Clara’s “Lost Album”, we hope that her real message will provide whatever other closure is necessary. The mere fact that Clara and Nadia, and Lev Sergeyevich and Bob Moog, can still provide us with such powerful beauty and inspiration long after they are gone is all we really need to remember.<br />

<h2 align="left">Clara’s Final Months and Her Death</h2>
<p>In September of 1997, my wife became pregnant with our first child, and the first grandchild or new generation child of the Sherman family. As we had promised long before, Clara was the first person we told. A welcome respite from the summer concerns, this child-to-be became Clara’s passion for the remainder of her days.</p>
<p>Her condition steadily worsened as 1998 unfurled, and on May 6, 1998, Clara suffered a massive stroke. On May 8, 1998, our daughter Fiona Nadia was born, and Clara was the first person we called. On May 10, at 9:34 AM, Clara died peacefully in her bed, in her home. On May 13, she was buried next to her husband Robert, her sister Nadia, and brother-in-law Sasha, and in the same cemetery as Leopold Auer and Paul Robeson.</p>
<p>If you will indulge me, I will conclude this narrative with the story of my daughter’s birth and Clara’s death – two events that were inextricably connected in Clara’s mind, her presence on earth and her future on earth. Rather than retell this story from memory, I will simply offer the notes I scribbled when I was asked to speak at Clara’s funeral. In preparation for my spoken eulogy, I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Clara loved telling and retelling stories, creating an oral history of sorts. One particular story Clara loved to tell was when I was all of about 6 or 7 years old, and reportedly had the audacity to ask her why, if she loved children so much, did she never have any children of her own. Clara’s response was surprisingly candid and honest – she explained that the doctor had told her and Bobby that she was just too petite, or as she put it, “not built for child birthing”, and that she might be at considerable risk. While she was willing to chance it, Bob could not bear the thought of losing her. After pondering this response, I announced that all of her nephews and nieces were in fact her children.</p>
<p>This story made quite an impression on me, and as I was growing up, I made it a habit to call her each year on Mother’s Day to wish her a Happy Mother’s Day. She was always touched by these calls, and they became vehicles to get into discussions about love and relationships. For the rest of my life, she would keep careful tabs on my love life, and no one was more genuinely happy when I finally got it right and married Dorothy.</p>
<p>And no one was more thrilled when we told her Dorothy was pregnant. Clara became totally enthralled with the baby to be, discussing what they would do together and making plans… Although she envisioned herself walking into the hospital with a big bunch of red roses to greet the newborn child, she gradually accepted that she would not be well enough and therefore would have to meet the child in her bed. She happily described placing the newborn baby right in the middle of her king size bed --- but then became consumed with fear that the baby might roll off the bed and land on the floor. Explaining that newborns don’t roll much and assuring her that we would be right there at all times (I even told her that to the baby, her bed would be just like a football field), she would then laugh, feigning embarrassment at having been so needlessly worried, and then delightedly add this story to her repertoire.</p>
<p>But she really was worried – she would often call us to inquire how Dorothy was and to ask how much more time till the due date. She became very involved, and very excited. She told us that she wanted this child to have her 1/4 size violin, still in it’s original red case (and this would always lead to a tangential story about how she used to drag this violin behind her on the floor because she was too small to carry it to the St. Petersburg Conservatory to study with Professor Auer after auditioning for him at the age of 4 standing on a table so he could see her…).</p>
<p>Her reasons for giving this violin to our child were made very clear. She loved to tell us that “If it is a boy, perhaps it will be another Jascha Heifetz, and if it is a girl, perhaps it will be another Clara Rockmore, and that’s not so bad either.” How she delighted in telling us this story each time. When we told her that it was in fact going to be a girl, she became even more fascinated about the prospect of “another Clara Rockmore” on the way. And when we told her that the child’s middle name would be Nadia, she cried.</p>
<p>Once, she confided to me that she felt like this was the child she never had. Another time, she said that this child would take her place on this earth.</p>
<p>During Clara’s last weeks, as her health was failing, this yet to be born child became Clara’s raison d’etre to stay alive, and it gave her great joy when the world seemed to turn dark -- any talk of the imminent birth would bring a big smile to her face.</p>
<p>During her last days, Clara succumbed to a stroke that all but froze her face and body, On Friday, May 8, our beautiful daughter Fiona Nadia was born, and the first person I called was Clara. When I called from the hospital, Betty relayed the message into Clara’s ear, and then cried out as she told me that Clara was smiling right through her frozen face. Two days later, appropriately on Mother’s Day, with the new generation begun and her “little Clara Rockmore” alive and well, Clara finally let go and died.”</p></blockquote>
