<p>ZANESVILLE -- Not many people have heard of the theremin, but plenty of people have heard it.</p>
<p>The theremin is the only musical instrument that doesn't require physical contact and one of the world's most talented players is coming to Zanesville to give a free concert. The instrument has appeared in music by Led Zeppelin, The Beach Boys, Nine Inch Nails and about 360 other rock bands.</p>
<p>Pamelia Kursten, 26, has been playing the instrument for five years and will perform at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday in the Elson Hall Auditorium on the Ohio University-Zanesville campus.</p>
