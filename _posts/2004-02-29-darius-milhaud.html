<p>Darius Milhaud (September 4, 1892 - June 22, 1974) was a French composer and teacher. He was a member of Les Six and one of the most prolific composers of the 20th century.</p>
<p>Milhaud was born in Aix-en-Provence and studied in Paris under Charles Widor and Vincent d'Indy. He emigrated to America in 1940, where he secured a teaching post at Mills College in Oakland, California. His compositions are particularly noted as being influenced by jazz and for their use of polytonality (music in more than one key at once).</p>
<p>Noted works include <i>Le Boeuf sur le Toit</i> (ballet), <i>La Cr√©ation du Monde</i> (jazz), <i>Saudades do Brazil</i> (dance suite), and <i>Notes Without Music</i> (an autobiography).</p>
<p>Notable students of Milhaud:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dave Brubeck</li>
<li>Burt Bacharach</li>
<li>Steve Reich</li>
</ul>
<p>Milhaud died in Geneva.</p>
