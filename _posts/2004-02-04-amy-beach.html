<p><i>Biography of pianist and composer Amy Beach.</i></p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_646" align="alignright" width="150"]<a href="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2004/02/Amy-Beach.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-646" alt="Amy Beach" src="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2004/02/Amy-Beach.jpg" width="150" height="206" /></a> Amy Beach (1867 - 1944).[/caption]</p>
<p>Amy Marcy Beach (September 5, 1867 - December 27, 1944), was a American pianist and composer of classical music. She was the first successful female American composer. Many of her composition and performances were under the name Mrs. H.H.A. Beach.</p>
<p>She was born Amy Marcy Cheney in Henniker, New Hampshire. She made her professional debut in Boston in 1883 and shortly thereafter appeared as a soloist with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Following her marriage in 1885 to Dr. Henry H.A. Beach, a Boston surgeon, however, she largely stopped performing and devoted herself instead to composition. After her husband died in 1910, she toured Europe as a pianist, playing her own compositions. She returned to America in 1914, where she spent time at the MacDowell Colony in Peterborough, New Hampshire. She died in New York City.</p>
<p>Her compositions include the Gaelic Symphony (1893), the Mass in E flat, a piano concerto, a quantity of choral music, chamber music, and piano music, and the opera Cabildo (1932). She was most popular, however, for her songs.</p>
