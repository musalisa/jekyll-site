<h2>The Birth of the Theremin</h2>

<p>In the years previous to 1920, a young student, Lev Sergeivitch Termen (a name which was thereafter gallicized to Léon Théremin), built an electronic musical instrument in St. Petersburg. It was a Thermionic tubed instrument. Théremin was not only a technician, but also a professional musician. He had studied physics at the University of St. Petersburg, studying courses of music theory and cello at the Musical Institute at the same time. In 1919, he had been nominated as Director of the Technical Laboratory (vibration research) at the Physics and Technical Institute. During a conference of Electrotecnicians in 1920, he presented the Termenvoksa or Heterophone, or Theremin, as it was called internationally. Those at the conference saw a small box with two antennae, one on the right and one on the left. Could it be a new type of telegraph? Or an electronic measuring device? Théremin moved to the front of the machine and began working it. There were no handles or keyboard. He waved his hands above the instrument like an orchestra conductor and seemed to obtain sounds as if by enchantment.</p>

<h2>How the Theremin Works</h2>
<p>A small metal rod protrudes from the top of the music stand, from which there is another metal coil located on the side. On the music stand itself, which is connected to the power supply for illumination, rests the music score. The conductor moves near and, having set off a switch, begins to wave his arms, as if conducting. Immediately, sounds begin flowing out from a speaker pointed in the direction of the audience. I certainly hope that the reader doesn’t think, not even for a minute, that I would let a merely far-flung idea flow out from my pen. It’s actually the invention, realized very practically, of a Russian technician, Leon Theremin, who lives in America, where he has already given many demonstrations. A large American producer of records and radio receivers has put the new musical instrument out on the market ever since 1930. The instrument, the “Thereminvox,” has no keyboard, no strings, no horns, and no other devices which would resemble a normal musical instrument. With one’s hand close to the metal rod - the vertical antenna - you hear a sound which becomes ever lower as the hand is moved away, while it becomes increasingly acute as the hand is brought closer. Removing the hand completely from the presence of the antenna, the sound ceases completely. It’s never necessary to touch the antenna. The coil located horizontally on the left side of the machine - the horizontal antenna - serves only for modifying the intensity of the sound produced. Lowering the hand on the coil, the power, and therefore the volume, decreases. So, the right hand regulates the pitch while the left hand regulates the intensity. With radio receivers, in use for several years now, moving one’s hand close to the tuning dial you are able to notice a kind of howling that ceases as soon as the hand is taken away. This phenomenon was then suppressed with the use of screens, made with metallic divisions between the various parts. Ever since that time, Theremin thought about utilizing this phenomenon to create a new musical instrument, which is precisely what he did. The operating principle is as follows: the device produces two oscillations at an inaudible frequency by means of two circuits oscillating at high frequencies. By moving one’s hands close to the two antennae, the vertical one and the horizontal one, a connection between the two circuits is produced. The overlapping of the two inaudible oscillations creates a “beating,” that is, further oscillations which are audible, whose pitch varies with the movement of the hands. The sounds produced with this system have some of the characteristics of a cello.</p>

<h2 align="left">Reactions in the Soviet Union</h2>
<p>It’s probably not surprising to anyone that Théremin’s invention provoked a chorus of indignant protests; the waves of opposition increased for ten years. But eventually, consent took over. And besides, the news continued to spread about some new instrument for making “electronic music,” and some clairvoyant individuals had already recognized the need for music made for the radio. In the “radiophonic” structure of these instruments, whatever they may have been, they saw the convincing proof of the radiophonic principle. But it was the music writers/composers who made the final call. Ernst Toch, after one of the first concerts in Germany with Théremin’s instrument, wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I, personally, have been trying for several years to widen the ranges of the orchestra in clear, determinate directions only... With Théremin’s instrument, one can find part of what I had in mind realized, and further, it presents unexpected possibilities of a new sonorous realm.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The first composer who utilized the new instrument was Andrej Filippovic Pascenko, student of Maximilian Steinberg and director of the Musical Library of the Philharmonic Orchestra in Leningrad for many years. In 1923, he wrote a symphonic Mystery for termenvoska and orchestra, which was performed for the first time in Leningrad in May of the following year under the conductorship of V. Dranisnikov. In December, 1924, Théremin requested for the copyrights for his invention from the patent office in Germany, and the patent office in the United States registered a perfected model of the instrument with the number 1661058 on February 28, 1928. This was an apparatus with eleven tubes, and the copyrights were composed of forty paragraphs which Théremin had listed with extreme precision.</p>
<p>During the 1920’s, an atmosphere favorable to political and artistic experiments still dominated in the Soviet Union. Just as there had been a clean cut from tradition in politics, so was the case for the field of music. At first, at least, many bridges were burned. The soviet government financed experiments on new artistic means with great generosity. At the bottom of it all was the desire to place a kind of equally new music, as an artistic symbol, side-by-side with the new social system. The government’s help was guaranteed even for the boldest progressivists. In 1924, the State Institute of Music in Moscow (GIMN) received a technical physics department. In the same year, S.N. Rshewkin, member of the acoustics commission, was working on a electric harmonium having four separate generators. He wanted to produce four-voice chords.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">[Fred K. Prieberg, <em>Musica ex machina</em>, Einaudi, Torino, 1963]</span></p>
<p>Futurism, as is already known, had differentiated political outcomes: if, in Italy, the principle representative of the movement, the poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, adhered to Fascism, in the Soviet Union the futurists participated in the moment of greatest innovative tension in the artistic world that followed the October Revolution. It is thanks to this climate that we can also include Lenin in our gallery of personalities who have been curious in different ways about new musical instruments (from Busoni to Varèse, and on to the “King of Brakes,” George Westinghouse). The Bolshevik leader assisted in a demonstration of a new instrument, the etherphone, and congratulating the inventor, surprised him with his immediate comprehension of the new musical horizons open to the device.</p>

<p>[Lenin] first proposed to [Termen] to study into creating an electronic alarm for the Kremlin (!), and then sent the same inventor on various tours abroad with his instrument, in such a way as to produce propaganda about the “scientific progress of the socialist, soviet homeland.” For once, he was right: in fact, during an evening in Paris, Termen had tremendous success before such musicians as Ravel and Respighi, with hundreds of people, unable to enter the theater, held back by the police. Berlin, Frankfurt, London, Dresden, Hamburg, Leipzig, Munich...</p>

<p>In 1924, the year of Lenin’s death, the State Institute of Musicology in Moscow had been equipped with a technical-physics department, but the impending changes in the Soviet world wouldn’t reveal themselves as being favorable to maintaining a climate of openness and experimentalism from the which the debuts of the Termenvoksa had so authoritatively benefited.</p>

<h2>The American Period</h2>
<p>[Theremin] had presented his instrument in Europe during several concert tours, he had made one or more etherphones resonate, together with human voices, pianos, harmoniums and celestas; and then, at the end of 1927, he had set off for the United States.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">[Fred K. Prieberg, <em>Musica ex machina</em>, Einaudi, Torino, 1963]</span></p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_123" align="aligncenter" width="204"]<a href="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2001/02/Lev-Termen-History-03.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-123" src="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2001/02/Lev-Termen-History-03.jpg" alt="Termen's wife Lavinia Williams." width="204" height="423" /></a> Termen's wife Lavinia Williams.[/caption]</p>
<p>[The] time was drawing near in which Termen would become Theremin. In fact, in 1928, the eclectic inventor (he had studied, among other things, the color television and anti-gravitational bridges) disembarked in New York in order to present the etherphone before Toscanini, Rachmaninov and Ford, and there, he decided to stop. Officially because the climate in the U.S.S.R. had changed, from the beginning when the avant-garde, artistic experiments were supported and financed by the regime - but, according to biographer Glinsky, with an additional, clear motive of committing espionage.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">[Paolo Beretta, “Suonare e non toccare,” in <em>Avvenire</em>, Milano, 3 gennaio 2001]</span></p>
<p>[In that period] Théremin brought some modifications to his instrument. He quickly realized that music “produced with gestures” from the hand using the high frequency vibrator, on which the etherphone was based, was not at all perfect. “Handling” the sound with precision in a small space which was not even one meter wide required sensibility and executive ability uncommon to most, since there were about seventy intervals. So, he built a model with a keyboard, which was a kind of electronic piano, then an instrument with handles having the form of a cello, on which one could play quick passages which naturally were not performable using an etherphone.</p>
<p>(…)</p>
<p>America, to be truthful, didn’t give him the success he’s hoped for, but it did offer prospectives which were more promising than those of the Soviet Union, where the initial liberality in the field of art little by little gave way to rigid political control. Here, in the country of unlimited possibilities, other composers began to become interested in Théremin’s instrument. Joseph Schillinger, both mathematician and composer, also collaborator with Théremin in inventing the electronic organ, in 1929 wrote a First Airphonic Suite, precisely for the etherphone. Shortly after, Théremin built an electric instrument controlled by a luminous flux called the “Rhythmicon” at the request of Henry Cowell, who had been presented to him by Nicolas Slonimsky. This machine was capable of reproducing the most complicated dynamic phrases and offered the precious help of metric and rhythmic combinations to Cowell’s inspirations. The nucleus of the instrument was a photocell. A keyboard controlled luminous impulses by means of double rotating gears-in front, large sprockets for the rhythm, in back tight sprockets for audio vibrations - and everything was put into motion with single movements. This apparatus, of which two models existed, one in Cowell’s possession and the other given up by Slonimsky to Schillinger - stirred great arousal in 1932 during an early concert at the New School for Social Research in New York. After the critic had agreeably affirmed that the instrument was not able to produce music, Cowell wrote two compositions for it and used it as a type of percussion: the concert was “Rhythmicana” in four movements, a polyrhythmic percussive performance united with an orchestra and “Music for Violin and Rhythmicon.” The first performance of this technical chamber music, which took place in the same year in San Francisco, astonished the critic of the “Argonaut” that he wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The accompaniment was a strange jumble of intricate rhythms and crisscross currents of such finesse and precision as were never heard before by human ears.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In the same year, Théremin gave a concert at Carnegie Hall in Manhattan in New York with his students. The stage was set up with electrical equipment, on the floor were various cables. Under the area designated for dancers, antennae were connected in such a way that a ballerina could create her own accompaniment using different steps and positions. One student gave a demonstration. Before the stupefied expressions of the public, she moved across the stage with orderliness, whirled her head with grace, and moved her arms sinuously... and as if by magic, precisely the Ave Maria by Bach-Gounod resonated. Then the students performed various pieces with the etherphone and another, similar instrument with a keyboard, whose sound reminded one of an oboe. Finally, they all came together to form an “electric orchestra.”<br />
<span style="font-size: small;">[Fred K. Prieberg, <em>Musica ex machina</em>, Einaudi, 1963]</span></p>
<p>Thanks to these performances (and above all the invention of an electronic security device...), Theremin became a millionaire, married a famous colored ballerina and enjoyed important friendships in the world of art and American finance: the composers Cowell, Varèse and Schillinger wrote for him; Lucie Rosen, the wife of a banker, insured him financially; Charlie Chaplin bought an instrument from him; even Einstein played a duet with him on the violin, and tried to find an equation that would unite music and physics.<br />
<span style="font-size: small;">[Paolo Beretta, “Suonare e non toccare,” in <em>Avvenire</em>, Milano, 3 gennaio 2001]</span></p>
<p>The most faithful supporter of Théremin’s art was Lucie Bigelow Rosen, nicknamed with a bit of exaggeration by the New York Times as the “Théremin’s high priestess.” As the wife of banker Walter T. Rosen, who was a music connoisseur, she had great means at her disposal which she used to spread the music. Théremin was given a studio and huge sums of money to use for the perfection of his instruments.</p>
<p>In that period there already existed an entire series of pieces composed expressly for the etherphone. Philips, a radio apparatus manufacturer, even made preparations for mass-producing Théremin apparati for domestic use, but then abandoned the project. Afterwards, the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) began to build the machines.</p>

<p>Having made the <i>enjoyment</i> of music universally possible, RCA takes another tremendous step - making possible not merely the <i>enjoiment</i> of <i>other people's</i> music, but the actual <i>creation</i> and <i>performance</i> of <i>one's own music!</i> Now, for the first time in the history of music, <i>anyone</i>, without musical knowledge or training of any sort; anyone, without even the ability to read notes; without tiresome or extended "practice"; without keys, or bow, or reed, or string, or wind, - without material media of any kind - <i>anyone can make exquisitely beautiful music with nothing but his own two hands!</i></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">[From the sales brochure for the RCA Theremin, 1929]</span></p>
<p>LEOPOLD STOKOWSKY, <i>Conductor of the famous Philadelphia Orchestra says:</i></p>
<p>"It is only a question of a few years before we shall have entirely new methods of tone production by electrical means. Some of this possibilities have been demonstrated by the Russian, Theremin ... thus will begin a new era in music ... One wonderful feature of the new electrical instrument is, or will be, that there is practically no technical difficulty in playing it. There will be no more long hours of practice every day. Electricity will do all the mechanical part. The musician will give musicianship, interpretation, variety of tone color and tone volume and all the non-material side of music."</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">[From the program for a promotional concert presented by piano seller John Wanamaker, New York, 1929]</span></p>
<p>Still, the strangest irony of the RCA Theremin was its purported ease of operation. To the average consumer, the freedom of space was really a disorienting weightlessness. Even a fretless fingerboard or a slide trombone had something to hang on to - a point of reference. The theremin called for the acute, inner ear of a singer to sense the location of each note before sounding it, but without any advantage of a physical sensation in the vocal cords or breath. [A] survey revealed that untrained performers preferred a keyboard orientation, with fixed pitch increments. Adding to the list of hindrances, the theremin was capable of playing only slow music, and it required an accompanying instrument or recording. For a device intended to replace the parlor piano, these were serious defects.</p>

<p>After some years, the cease of sales (due to the economic depression following the great crises of 1929) forced the interruption of the machine’s production. However, the etherphones which got on the market aroused the interest of some noted composers. Nicolas Slonimsky arranged his piece for the piano called "Dream Scents" and part of Silhouettes iberiennes"; Edgard Varèse composed his "Equatorial" for two Théremin apparati in 1934 and he widened it’s instrumentation several years later; in 1937, Percy Grainger wrote “Free Music” for six etherphones. Bohuslav Martinu, who took refuge for a number of years to flee the war and foreign domination, composed a "Fantasy" in 1944 for the Théremin instrument, the oboe, string quartet and the piano, and he dedicated it to Mrs. Rosen. In regard to this piece, the “Neue Zurcher Zeitung later wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>“’Fantasy’ for the Théremin, the oboe, string quartet, and piano was an artistic event of grand importance, written by Bohuslav Martinu, who ingeniously utilized the special qualities of the instrument; the spectral gestures of the soloist were also very effective, which reminded one of the magic which is the origin of all music.”</p></blockquote>

<h2 align="left">Return to the Soviet Union</h2>
<p>In 1938, he was kidnapped by the NKVD (that would later become the K.G.B.), taken clandestinely back to the U.S.S.R., sentenced for “anti-Soviet propaganda” and isolated in a labor camp in Magadan, Siberia. After a few years, he was assigned to work in a secret research laboratory, where he “collaborated” in the creation of the “buran,” or the “bug.” Rehabilitated, he then taught at the Music Conservatory in Moscow until his death.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">[Claudia Azzalin, “Suonare e non toccare,” in <em>Virtual</em>, Milano, maggio 1996]</span></p>
<p>Rumor has it that he was kidnapped by the K.G.B. (he was sent to a Siberian labor camp for three months). While saving the details for his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=thereminvox-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=ASIN/0252025822/qid=1117146841/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1" target="_blank">book</a>, Professor Glinsky said the circumstances were actually more complex than that. The inventor remained under house arrest until 1947, when he was secretly awarded the Stalin Prize for inventing the Soviet Union’s first electronic eavesdropping device.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">[Eric Taub, “The Theremin: Music at Your Fingertips, or Your Elbows or Knees,” in <em>The New York Times on the Web</em>, April 22, 1999]</span></p>
<p>Professor Lev Sergeivich Termen, known in the West as Leon Theremin, was removed from New York in 1938 by the N.K.V.D., predecessor of the K.G.B., tried, convicted and sent to the hellish Siberian Gulag in Magadan. He wasn’t under “house arrest,” as the article states; he was in prison for some time, as were millions of other innocent Russians during Stalin’s Great Purges. In my film, Professor Theremin, on camera, clearly states, “I was in prison.” Rumor, eh? In addition, Beryl Campbell, the best friend of Theremin’s wife at the time, the dancer Lavinia Williams, recounts on camera Lavinia’s frantic telephone call after Russian goons took Theremin away. More Rumor? I spent five years making “Theremin” and spent a lot of time with the amazing Professor Theremin. His treatment by the Soviets denied the world his genius for over half a century. I stand behind my work.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">[Steven Martin, “Another Theremin View,” in <em>The New York Times on the Web</em>, April 28, 1999]</span></p>
<p>What had happened? According to some, the “flight” was a skilful operation by the N.K.V.D. (the forerunner of the K.G.B.), who kidnapped the inventor; for others - like Glinsky - it was a voluntary return to his homeland to escape his creditors.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">[Paolo Beretta, Suonare e non toccare,” in <em>Avvenire</em>, Milano, 3 gennaio 2001]</span></p>
<p>In 1945, together with the New York City Symphony Orchestra, directed by Leopold Stokowski, Clara Rockmore executed a concert for eterphone and orchestra by Anis Fuleihan for the first time; in the same period, the instrument made its appearance in two film scores by Miklòs Ròsza in order to obtain a psychological effect that would not have been producible in any other way. In Spellbound - wrote “Time” magazine - the “unnatural moan of the contralto” served for the characterization of the fainting hero. In The Lost Week End, directed by Billy Wilder, the instrument musically symbolized the need for alcohol that reawakened in the young writer, that entices him in the bars, that induces him to steal, until the intentions to commit suicide become ever-more consistent, and during his delirium, fluttering bats finally appear. It wasn’t the first time that Hollywood took advantage of the etherphone, but these two films caused such a stir that from 1945 on, the instrument became popular in the cinematographic industry.</p>

<p>(...) It was once again in the U.S.A. that (...) a certain Robert Moog, fourteen-year-old with a passion for electronics, built himself a homemade Theremin, copying the plans from a magazine. Moog would shortly become the inventor of the first musical synthesizer called, none other than: the Moog. And the Big Briar, Bob Moog’s American industry, still builds various models of the Theremin, selling them even on the Internet and in build-it-yourself kits: all it takes is a ‘clic’ and $299 to receive a kit with the “unforgettable” instrument right at home, complete with a demonstration video.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">[Paolo Beretta, “Suonare e non toccare,” in <em>Avvenire</em>, Milano, 3 gennaio 2001]</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Russian musician / inventor never knew about these events, so rich in favorable prospects.</p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>For many long years, nothing was known about him in the West; even in articles about electronic music which have been published by the Soviet press, his name was missing for a long time, although they must have been proud of the Soviet inventor of the first electronic musical instrument. Only a quick mentioning in the magazine “Sovjetskaja Muzyka” from May of 1961 made note of the fact that Théremin was living in Moscow like before. Stalin’s Esthetics - officially mitigated in the meantime by the Central Commission of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union - was at that time rigidly focused on “socialist realism.” Naturally, the fact that, in order to produce sound by means of an electronic tube, the need for a man was only indirectly necessary, and the man was assigned a new function, this gave rise to a series of reflections of a cultural-political nature. It’s true that no prohibition was enacted, however the musical instrument construction office in use up until that time was closed without delay - as was stated in the “Sovjetskaja Kultura” on August 27, 1953. Later, a Soviet delegation for the construction of electronic musical instruments declared that “the playing of electronic instruments leads to a depersonalization of musical exercise.” It’s certain that new material liberty and the absence of every kind of mechanicalness collided violently with the differently-oriented ideology of “socialist realism.” Théremin, his instruments and those of the other Soviet inventors didn’t go hand-in-hand with the conception of the world which was in vigor during those years. This is probably the real reason why they were eliminated.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">[Fred K. Prieberg, <em>Musica ex machina</em>, Einaudi, Torino, 1963]</span></p>
<p>Theremin - who then was “rehabilitated” in his homeland, from 1966 on worked at the Conservatory in Moscow developing other models (including polyphonic ones) of his machine and in 1991, he returned to visit the United States-making it in time to see the revival of his creation, which has been used, for example, by Led Zeppelin, by the Beach Boys, by Jean Michel-Jarre... The inventor died, in fact, in 1993: the day after the “debut” of the American documentary "Theremin. An Electronic Odyssey”, completely dedicated to his incredible history.</p>
