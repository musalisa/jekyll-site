<p><i>An interview with canadian thereminist Peter Pringle.</i></p>

<p><a href="http://www.peterpringle.com/" target="_blank">Peter Pringle</a> is an eclectic musician, singer and songwriter from Canada. He became involved in music as a child singing with the children's chorus of the <a href="http://www.coc.ca/" target="_blank"> Canadian Opera Company</a> and studying classical piano. In the 1960's he moved to the United States where he started a successful songwriting and filmscoring activity and began studying classical lute with the former theremin cellist Leonid Bolotine. In the mid 1960's he went to India to study the <a href="http://www.ragascape.com/Ragascapes/3.html" target="_blank">surbahar</a> (an instrument similar to the sitar but larger and with a deeper tone) and indian music with Ravi Shankar. From the mid 70's Peter Pringle developed his career as a pop singer, putting out several LP's and starring in TV shows. He also toured in his one-man-show Noel Coward: A Portrait and performed it for President Bush (senior) and the British royal family. Peter pringle plays many different musical instruments, but it was only in 1996, after he retired from the pop music scene, that he discovered the theremin and devoted his time and energies to the study of this intrument. After almost six years of studies and experimentation he has released <i><a href="http://www.peterpringle.com/voices.html" target="_blank">Many Voices</a></i>, his first theremin CD.</p>
<p><b>Saggini:</b> Looking at your theremin repertoire becomes pretty evident your love for opera music. And, referring to your theremin player activity, you once said that you're a "Maria Callas wannabee"; in another occasion, you explained why you have preference for the highest registers of the theremin saying that you are "obsessed with sopranos". I've also read that you studied singing at the children's chorus of the Canadian Opera Company, but you left the school when, as you were growing up, your voice changed from soprano to baritone. Is your current dedication to the theremin a way to settle an old account?</p>
<p><b>Pringle:</b> Yes, I think this is probably true, although I am not consciously aware of it. I have loved opera (and in particular ITALIAN opera) since I was about 7 or 8 years old. Although I may have had a voice suitable for classical music when I was a little boy, my adult voice was definitely better suited to popular music. I might add that it is also much easier to make a living in popular music than it is in classical.</p>
<p>Two of the important operas that I sang in as a child, and that stand out very clearly in my mind were Puccini's TOSCA (the voice of the shepherd boy in Act III) and Gian Carlo Menotti's AMAHL AND THE NIGHT VISITORS.</p>
<p>The wonderful thing about speaking to Italians about my love of opera, my love of the voices of Gigli, Tebaldi, Gobbi and many, many others, is that I don't have to explain it or apologize for it. Italians understand, even younger Italians, because they grow up with it. In most of the world, opera has traditionally been an artform for the elite and the aristocracy. In Italy it is the music of the people. This will probably change over the next few generations as music and entertainment become increasingly americanized throughout the world.</p>
<p><b>Saggini:</b> Americanization is running faster than you may think. Anyway, speaking of singing and singing with the theremin, I remember that Léon Theremin once said that "ether wave music is created with a simplicity and a directness matched only by singing". We should know by now that playing the theremin is not as easy as Léon Theremin and RCA marketing copy-writers said, but I'd like to know if once you master the instrument you feel something similar to the joy of singing.</p>
<p><b>Pringle:</b> I definitely do. Perhaps that is because I have always been a singer. It is possible that someone who plays the violin or the cello would feel differently about it. One of the things about playing great vocal music on the theremin is that you can play something you could not possibly ever sing. I cannot sing NESSUN DORMA but I can play it on the theremin and get a tremendous amount of pleasure doing it.</p>
<p>I noticed when I first started playing the theremin, that I had a tendency to "sub-vocalize" when I played. That means that I had all the tension in my vocal cords that a singer would have, but I was not making any audible vocal sound. I STILL DO THAT! I tried to stop myself from doing it, but it required too much concentration just to remember NOT to do it. When you play the theremin, there is no room for concentration on anything except playing.</p>
<p><b>Saggini:</b> In your CD there is a piece entitled "Ellington on 54th Street" and this makes me wonder of what could had happened if Ellington had experimented with the theremin when he tried to make musical instruments sound as the human voice and <a href="http://museum.media.org/duke/sing/singsong.html" target="_blank">viceversa</a>. The unique features of the theremin, as described passionately by Clara Rockmore in the interview to Bob Moog, seem to share something of both. What do you think?</p>
<p><b>Pringle:</b> I was asking myself the same question when I wrote ELLINGTON ON 54TH STREET. How would someone like Duke Ellington have used the theremin? Of course, we will never know the answer to this question but it is fun to experiment with possibilities. As you know, West 54th Street in Manhattan, was where Leon Theremin had his research studio and laboratory during the 1930's.</p>
<p>Yes, the theremin has many of the qualities of both an instrument AND the human voice. The problem with the theremin in the 1930's was that most thereminists - even the professional ones - were not very good. The exception was Clara Rockmore, who was probably the finest theremin virtuoso who ever lived, but she played mainly transcriptions of classical music written originally for the violin or cello, and would probably not have been very interested in experimenting with Jazz.</p>
<p>Samuel Hoffman, although he had been playing for quite a long time, did not appear on the theremin scene until after 1945, which was the end of the "Big Band Era" and he never showed much interest in Jazz.</p>
<p>The advantage that modern thereminists have is that an instrument now exists (the Moog Music Ethervox theremin) that is reliable and has a range three times greater than the range of the original RCA instruments. We can now experiment with all sorts of sounds that would have been unthinkable for the early pioneers of the theremin.</p>
<p><b>Saggini:</b> So what about a theremin rendition of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000062TCS?tag=thereminvox-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;creativeASIN=B000062TCS&amp;creative=373489&amp;camp=211189" target="_blank">Adelaide Hall</a>'s vocal line in "Creole Love Call"?</p>
<p><b>Pringle:</b> One of the things about the theremin is that it has a great sense of humor! It could do a great Adelaide Hall - or Jeannette Macdonald (Indian Love Call).</p>
<p><b>Saggini:</b> Leon Theremin and Leopold Stokowski repeatedly said that the theremin would have been used for the "music of the future". Unfortunately this didn't happen, and today, after one hundred years of permanent avantgarde, becomes legitimate to think that the music of the future will be very similar to the music of the past. What do you think about it, and what could be the future of the theremin?</p>
<p><b>Pringle:</b> It is difficult to say what people like Leon Theremin, Leopold Stokowski, Percy Grainger and many others, actually meant when they referred to "the music of the future". Many of these men spoke very grandly of some artistic Utopia where musicians would be "freed from the constraints and limitations of keys and strings and wooden boxes". This is a very appealing idea but, like all Utopias, it is a fictional concept. In the final analysis, audiences do not seem to enjoy these forays into this mythical musical future. Composers and performers must always ask themselves, 'What am I creating? Will people be moved by what I am doing? Am I writing music for today, or am I composing for future listeners that I have created in my imagination?'</p>
<p><b>Saggini:</b> You own <a href="http://www.peterpringle.com/meethoffman.html" target="_blank">Samuel Hoffman's theremin</a>, which was used in more than forty film soundtracks. Do you think that the theremin could still be interesting to soundtrack composers?</p>
<p><b>Pringle:</b> Yes. I do think the theremin could be interesting to composers of all sorts of music - not just film sound tracks. The problem with the theremin has always been, 'WHO IS GOING TO PLAY IT?' The theremin has a unique quality that cannot be successfully imitated by other instruments or by keyboard samplers. The difficulty is that there are only a few thereminists in the world who are going to be able to make your musical concept a reality. This was true when composer Miklos Rozsa first used the theremin on the sound track of Alfred Hitchcock's SPELLBOUND, and it is still true today.</p>
<p><b>Saggini:</b> You've had a long career in music as a songwriter, filmscore writer and also as a singer; and you've played many different musical intruments. Then in 1996, only after many years on the music scene, you discovered the theremin. Can you tell us what happened?</p>
<p><b>Pringle:</b> One afternoon, in 1996, I turned on the radio and heard a sound that stopped me in my tracks. I did not know what I was listening to because the composition had already started. Was it a human voice? Was it a machine? WHAT WAS IT? It turned out to be Clara Rockmore's recording of her theremin signature song, THE SWAN, by the 19th century French composer, Camille Saint-Saens. Like many other people, I fell in love with the theremin. I had heard the theremin many times but until that moment I had no idea that it could be played with such musicality and sensitivity. I always thought it was just an effects device used for suspense and horror films.</p>
<p>I immediately ordered an Etherwave theremin kit from Moog Music, assembled it the moment it arrived, and proceeded to teach myself how to play it.</p>
<p><b>Saggini:</b> What happened next? Tell us about the first impact with the instrument and about what made you decide to become a professional thereminist.</p>
<p><b>Pringle:</b> I never decided to become a professional thereminist. It just happened! A thereminist needs three things: a very good ear for pitch (you do not need "perfect pitch"), a steady hand with good hand/ear coordination, and excellent muscle memory.</p>
<p>I have done many theremin presentations and at the end of a demonstration I always invite people to come up onto the stage and try out the instrument. I have noticed over the years that there are certain people who take to the instrument instantly, and who can play better after 30 seconds than some people can after 30 years. Of course, that does not mean that they are goiing to love it or that they are going to want to learn to play the theremin but if they did, they would advance very quickly.</p>
<p>One of the advantages I had in becoming a precision thereminist is that I had a huge repertoire of music in my head before I started. I have played the piano since I was a child, and I picked up several other instruments over the years. When I took up the theremin in 1996, the music was already inside my head. I just had to learn to express it on the theremin.</p>
<p><b>Saggini:</b> Is the theremin the most important instrument in this particular moment of your artistic life? And do you feel that your love for the theremin will be forever, or it can be that in the future your time and energies will be devoted to some other instrument?</p>
<p><b>Pringle:</b> We never know what the future will bring but, for the moment, certainly the theremin is the most important instrument in my musical life. One thing about it, however, is that my interest in the theremin and my need to be able to accompany myself on other instruments, has caused me to become a better piano player, a better harpist, and better at a number of other instruments that I use in combination with the theremin.</p>
<p>Anyone who plays an instrument that is monophonic (like the flute or the oboe that have only one voice) is going to have to provide accompaniment for their repertoire. As the virtuoso thereminist, Clara Rockmore, once said in an interview, "I had the good luck to be born the sister of the great pianist Nadia Reisenberg". Of course, these days we have multi-track recording (which was not available in the 1930's) so if you can play another instrument, it is possible to accompany yourself for the purpose of recording. On stage, it is another matter.<br />
<!--nextpage--><br />
<b>Saggini:</b> Please tell us about your seven years long study of the theremin, how you devised and elaborated your theremin technique and how much you derived from other players techniques.</p>
<p><b>Pringle:</b> When I began studying the theremin, I had no method to follow and no teacher. Like most budding thereminists, I just did what felt right. This turned out to be a mistake. Ever since the theremin was invented, people have thought that it must be easy because nothing is touched. You are completely free, so there are no rules and no constraints. It is true, you may be free of strings, keys and wooden boxes but you are not free of the limitations of your own human body. In a way, with the theremin, "the</p>
<p>instrument" is not the box with the two antennas. THE INSTRUMENT IS THE THEREMINIST. The limit to what you can do will depend on what sort of music you wish to play and whether you wish to be a "precision thereminst".</p>
<p>By "precision thereminist", I mean someone who can accurately and precisely articulate melodies on the theremin. Musicians who play experimental music, free music, avant garde, etc. or who use the instrument as an effects device, do not necessarily require the same control or discipline. It is like the difference between a painter who paints portraits, and an artist who creates his works by throwing paint at the canvas. Both are valid but they are quite different.</p>
<p>In 1997, <i>The First International Theremin Festival</i> was held in Portland, Maine, in the U.S.A. I attended this event and had the only theremin lesson I have ever had in my life. Everyone who participated in the event got to have one lesson with Russian thereminist, Lydia Kavina. Like all the men at the festival, I fell madly in love with Lydia! She was warm, intelligent, beautiful and had a wonderful sense of humor. I carefully set up my theremin in the little studio Lydia had been given for her students, and I played for her. When I finished, she told me quite bluntly that if I continued playing the way I was playing, I was not going to be able to progress any further.</p>
<p>You must understand that the theremin cannot be played melodically without vibrato. It is the technique of vibrato that gives the thereminist the leeway to find the note in the air and "shape" it or "form" it into a musical experience for the listener while rendering pitch inconsistencies inaudible. Lydia Kavina pointed out that the technique I was using for producing vibrato was basically a back and forth "wiggling" or "shaking" motion of the wrist which is impossible to control. Vibrato on the theremin must be produced by a controlled motion of the entire forearm. Basically, Lydia told me I had to change my entire approach to the instrument.</p>
<p>She was absolutely right.</p>
<p>When I returned home from the festival, I managed to get a pirated copy of Clara Rockmore's CAMERA 3 television special. This program has since been commercially re-issued as CLARA ROCKMORE, THE GREATEST THEREMIN VIRTUOSA and can be purchased from Moog Music. Anyway, I began to carefully study the Rockmore theremin technique which is called "aerial fingering". This method has many advantages over other approaches to the instrument and I have found that it offers maximum control with minimum effort.</p>
<p>It's not that I wanted to play like Clara Rockmore but I wanted to possess her control, her stamina and her ease with the instrument. I'm still working on it.</p>

<p>It's not that I wanted to play like Clara Rockmore but I wanted to possess her control, her stamina and her ease with the instrument. I'm still working on it.</p>
<p><b>Saggini:</b> Two of the current greatest theremin players, Lydia Kavina and Pamelia Kurstin, are teaching theremin, do you plan to do the same?</p>
<p><b>Pringle:</b> No, I do not.</p>
<p><b>Saggini:</b> It's not easy to acquire a vintage tube theremin like the ones you use. Do you think that this could be a problem for aspiring thereminists?</p>
<p><b>Pringle:</b> No. There is no advantage to having a vintage theremin. The old tube instruments are very unreliable and are in constant need of maintenance and repair. One time, when I was promoting a concert, I appeared on a television show and took the Hoffman theremin along for a demonstration. The show was a "live" interview so there was no rehearsal or preparation. I set the theremin up, tested it briefly, and everything was fine. During the show, however, when I went over to the instrument to play it, IT WAS DEAD. Nothing! No sound!</p>
<p>This is an example of the kinds of things that can happen with vintage RCA's. It turned out that the powerful electromagnetic fields generated by the television cameras and the other equipment in the TV studio were too much for the Hoffman theremin and it was overwhelmed. It worked when I tested it because the cameras were not on. This does not happen with modern instruments.</p>
<p>Another advantage of modern theremins - like the Ethervox theremin - is that they have a much greater range. The RCA has about three and a half octaves, while the Ethervox has almost ten octaves and three separate register settings.</p>
<p><b>Saggini:</b> But what about the tone? Do you think that vintage tube theremins could be considered what the Stradivarius are for violinists?</p>
<p><b>Pringle:</b> No. I do not. A Stradivarius cannot be imitated. A tube theremin could be, although no one has yet done it.</p>
<p><b>Saggini:</b> Until some years ago there was only a professional thereminist in the world. But now besides <a href="http://www.postman.ru/~tvox/" target="_blank">Lydia Kavina</a> we have, at least, <a href="http://www.pameliakurstin.com/" target="_blank">Pamelia Kurstin</a> and you. This could be the major result of the "theremin renaissance" of which has been talked about. Do you think that the availability of professional thereminist could stimulate the use of the theremin in contemporary music?</p>
<p><b>Pringle:</b> It might. Again, the problem will be that a composer is going to have to find a thereminist who can play what he wants to hear. If there were 300 virtuoso thereminists in the world that would be easy. With only a very few it can get extremely expensive. What do you do if you are a composer in Rome and you need a thereminist? Fly someone in from Moscow or New York City? If we want to have a genuine "theremin renaissance" we are going to need more than three thereminists. We are going to need three thousand!</p>
<p><b>Saggini:</b> Your CD provides a beautiful example of the expressive potential of the theremin when it's played with great virtuosity. But it seems to me that if you had used real musical instruments for the bases instead of digital midi devices mimicking the real ones, the sound of the theremin would have been best appreciated. Do you think this will change in the future?</p>
<p><b>Pringle:</b> My problem was money. It is too expensive to hire an orchestra - even a SMALL orchestra - in America. I had thought about the possibility of going to Prague to record some of the instrumental tracks because costs in some of the countries of Eastern Europe are much lower and the musicians are excellent. Still, it would have been many thousands of dollars, plus the cost of traveling. I decided to record everything myself, using as many acoustic instruments as possible (like the harp, the piano and the ghironda) and use synthesizers for the rest. After all, the theremin is the grandfather of the synthesizer so it was like a "family affair".</p>
<p><b>Saggini:</b> Your CD is a pout-pourri of different musical styles and as such it shows the versatility of the instrument, as well as of the thereminist, of course. But what are your intentions for the future, what musical style you like best for the theremin?</p>
<p><b>Pringle:</b> I am already working on my next CD. Its working title is - MUSIC UNTOUCHED - and all the music on it is gestural. It is all theremin and MIDI theremin. There are no instruments on it that are touched in any way by the musician. Of course, the style of music on it is strictly electronic but I am trying to create something that people will want to listen to more than once!</p>
<p><b>Saggini:</b> Do you plan to make concerts?</p>
<p><b>Pringle:</b> I will probably do some appearances but I will have to wait and see what sort of offers I have.</p>
<p><b>Saggini:</b> What goals are you trying to achieve with the publication of your CD?</p>
<p><b>Pringle:</b> I am always surprised at how few people have ever heard of the theremin. In spite of books, magazines, documentary films etc., the theremin is still unknown. I am hoping for two things with the release of my CD. I would like to see an increase in general awareness of the instrument and I am hoping that MANY VOICES will inspire young musicians to study the theremin as a second instrument. As Clara Rockmore pointed out, the theremin should never be anyone's first instrument.</p>
<p><b>Saggini:</b> In your musical career you have gained success and obtained a wide popularity; but don't you think that your current dedication to such an obscure and unpopular instrument like the theremin could be like some sort of <i>seppuku</i> for your musical career?</p>
<p><b>Pringle:</b> I already committed musical 'hara kiri' when I retired in 1995. One thing about a popular music career is that it is like the career of a professional athelete. There is a time limit on it. About 85% of the CD's that are sold in the world are bought by kids between the ages of 12 and 20. These people do not want to hear a popular singer who is 50 years old! They want to hear a singer who is 15 years old. This is something that many successful pop music artists have difficulty accepting. Yes, if you are a superstar of legendary proportions, you can go on forever doing geriatric rock tours. If you are like most people in popular music, however, you have three choices: you can permanently retire to a lovely villa by the sea, you can re-invent yourself by taking up some crazy instrument like the theremin, or you can commit REAL "seppuku", like Dalida.</p>
<p><b>Saggini:</b> Is there something you would like to say to contemporary composers about the theremin?</p>
<p><b>Pringle:</b> Hmmm.....Yes, there is one important thing I would like to point out to composers. If you wish to write for the instrument, make sure you understand its limitations and its strong points. I have had compositions submitted to me by young composers but they cannot be played on the theremin! What often happens is that the composer will make a "demo" of his theremin piece using a keyboard snythesizer without understanding that what he is doing cannot be translated to the theremin. He can hear it in his mind but it cannot be played. All musical instruments have limitations and it is important to be aware of them if you wish to compose. It is easy to find out whether</p>
<p>something can be played on the violin or the cello because there are plenty of violinists and cellists around who you can ask. The obscurity of the theremin makes getting information more difficult.</p>
<p>Modern composers should remember that in the past, when composers have written for a particular instrument, they often had a particular virtuoso in mind and frequently that virtuoso happened to be an acquaintance of the composer.</p>
<p>Make friends with a thereminist!</p>
<p><b>Saggini:</b> But for what reasons the theremin should be appealing for contemporary composers?</p>
<p><b>Pringle:</b> The theremin has a unique, mysterious quality to it when it is played well. No other instrument can imitate it (except perhaps the human voice), it has a ten octave range, and perhaps most importantly it fills listeners with wonder and amazement. One of the problems with the theremin has always been that there have been so few thereminists. Historically, composers who actually DID write for the instrument (like Edgard Varese, Martinu, Schillinger and others) have ended up having to settle for an ondes Martenot player because no professional thereminist could be found.</p>
<p><b>Saggini:</b> What are, in your opinion, the most significant scores originally written for the theremin to date?</p>
<p><b>Pringle:</b> Sadly, Valerio, there is nothing that I consider to be of any real musical importance that has been written for the theremin. That is my personal opinion. The theremin seems to have made its mark in filmscore sound tracks and not in modern serious music. The CONCERTO FOR THEREMIN AND ORCHESTRA by the American composer, Anis Fuleihan, is a wonderful vintage curiosity but it is not a great piece of music. There are many new and interesting compositions being written for the theremin today but, like much modern music, these works are often never heard again after their debut. There is no public demand for them. It is one of the tragedies of the theremin that none of the great composers of the 20th century (like Gershwin, Rachmaninoff or Menotti or Messiaen) ever chose to write for the instrument. It attracted some very competent lesser composers whose works have been largely forgotten.</p>
<p><b>Saggini:</b> How one can buy your CD or contact you for concert offerings?</p>
<p><b>Pringle:</b> The CD can be purchased through my website:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.peterpringle.com/" target="_blank">http://www.PeterPringle.com</a></p>
<p>As far as concerts are concerned, I do very few of them and those that I do are close to home. I recently refused an offer to go to Japan. I figuered if I am going to commit "seppuku", I don't have to go to Japan to do it. I can do it at home!</p>
