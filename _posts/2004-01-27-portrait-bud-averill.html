<p>"Bud" Averill was a very obscure Thereminist and the proprietor of a restaurant (late 30's, early 40's?). I am not sure exactly where! I think it was in California. "Bud" used to entertain his customers at "Paradise Cafe" with the Theremin. Oh yeah, Kansas City Steaks and Georgia Fried Chicken were their specialty!</p>
<p>I believe he also collaborated with other musicians on "West Of The Wasatch", "The Union Pacific", and "Our Bambino", a musical tribute to Babe Ruth...</p>
<p>Bud Averill was also proprietor of Averill's Airport sometime in the 30's. The address is the same as Paradise Cafe. I am not sure which name was used first... To the best of my knowledge, there was never an airport or air field located at or even near 674 S Vermont Avenue in Los Angeles. That location, which is just south of Wilshire Blvd, and east of Koreatown (which wouldn’t have been in existence yet, in the late 1930's, when this matchbook cover was made) is just too full of streets and buildings to have an open space for a plane to land. This matchbook featuring a red bi-plane on its back cover, and a modern silver one sky-writing on its inside, specifies that Bud Averill’s Airport was an “exclusive prop and wing club for the flying fraternity” and advertises on the front cover that the establishment is a place “where time flies.” Manufacturer is Diamond Match Company, NYC.</p>
