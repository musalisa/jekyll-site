<p>Alexandra Stepanoff was Léon Théremin's first theremin student in the United States. Formerly a concert singer, around the late twenties she moved from Russia to New York where, thanks to the local russian community, she met Léon Théremin.</p>

<p>Stepanoff participated in the 1928 open-air concert at New York's Lewishom Stadium, as a member of the theremin quartet (formed, besides her, by Théremin himself, Julius Goldberg and the russian emigrant Moissaye Olgin) that played along with the New York Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra.</p>
<p>From 1929 to 1930, being involved in the RCA marketing effort to "popularize the theremin as an instrument available to any unskilled person with a love for music but who is not trained in any instrument requiring years of study" (see Albert Glinsky, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0252025822?tag=thereminvox-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;creativeASIN=0252025822&amp;creative=373489&amp;camp=211189" target="_blank">Theremin. Ether Music and Espionage</a>, University of Illinois Press, Urbana and Chicago, 2000, 101), Stepanoff gave presentations of the RCA Theremin at Radio Fairs.</p>
<p>In 1929, along with Zenaide Hanenfeldt (another immigrant from Russia to New York City, later to become George Gershwin's secretary), she gave presentations four time a day at the RCA demonstration booth at the Boston Radio Exposition, playing "Mother Machree," "The Pink Lady," and "Because."</p>
<p>In 1930, Stepanoff's presentations at the eighth annual Chicago Radio Show were broadcasted over the NBC radio network and heard by twenty-six major cities from New York to San Francisco.</p>
