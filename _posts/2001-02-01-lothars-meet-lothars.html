<p><a href="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/264-400x500.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-868" alt="Meet the Lothars" src="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/264-400x500.jpg" width="202" height="169" /></a>This <a href="http://www.wobblymusic.com/lothars/" target="_blank">band</a> is weird. Well their music is. Weird but fun. They have published several cd's now, of which I have one called <i><a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lothars1/from/thereminvox" target="_blank">Meet the Lothars</a></i>. On this cd you hear 3 theremins and one electric guitar. Their last cd, <i><a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lothars3/from/thereminvox" target="_blank">Oscillate My Metalic Sonatas</a></i>, features four theremins and a guitar. Their music sounds improvised, and many of their songs are indeed created that way. One time this works out real fine, another time, you wonder where the song is going. Never the less fun stuff to listen to.</p>
<p>Check <a href="http://www.wobblymusic.com/lothars/" target="_blank">their site</a> for info about newer cd's. There are some songs to download as well!</p>
