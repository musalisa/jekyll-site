<p><i>A new file has been uploaded in the Audio Library.</i></p>
<p>It is "Rotors of Raga" by BrotherSync (Bryan Helm, David Miller and Bret Moreland).</p>
<p>Here is a note from Bret:</p>
<p>"This piece features Theremin by David Miller, Korg synths by Bryan Helm, Huey Helicopters and Moog synths by me.</p>
<p>I have long loved the variety of sounds that Hueys make. This piece is centered around a field recording of several Hueys flying, sometimes passing within 30 feet of my binaural microphones (on my head).</p>
<p>This is not exactly a song, consider it a 'sonic adventure'. Thanks to David Miller for collaborating with us on this with the haunting melody line he composed and played."</p>
