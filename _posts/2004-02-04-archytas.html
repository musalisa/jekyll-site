<p>Archytas was born in Tarentum, Magna Graecia (now Italy) and was the son of Mnesagoras or Histiaeus. He was taught for a while by Philolaus and he was a teacher of mathematics to Eudoxus of Cnidus. He was scientist of the Pythagorean school, famous as the intimate of end of Plato. His and Eudoxus' student was Menaechmus.</p>
<p>Sometimes he is believed to be the founder of mathematical mechanics.</p>
<p>According to Eutocius Archytas solved the problem of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubling_the_cube" target="_blank">duplicating the cube</a> in his manner with a geometric construction. Hippocrates of Chios before reduced this problem to finding mean <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional" target="_blank">proportionals</a>. Archytas' theory of proportions is treated in the book VIII. of Euclid's Elements.</p>
<p>The Archytas curve, which he used in his solution of the doubling the cube problem, is named after him.</p>
