  content: I've just received my copy of the Lost Theremin Album. It's beautiful.
    The simplicity of the instrument coupled with the incredibly talented Clara Rockmore
    is nearly overwhelming. Thank you for releasing these recordings.

<p>Dear Levnet -</p>
<p>I don't think I've ever actually posted on Levnet, or at least haven't since Clara died in 1998.</p>
<p>I am Steve Sherman, Clara Rockmore's great-nephew and Nadia Reisenberg's grandson (my dad Bob Sherman is Nadia's younger son), and a photographer in the musical performing arts (<a href="http://www.stevejsherman.com/" target="_blank">www.stevejsherman.com</a>). During Clara's last years, I was also the person who spent the most time with her (aside from her nurses), visiting almost daily from my nearby office and caring for her while she was ill, up until her death.</p>
<p>So it is with deep personal pleasure that I announce that Clara's second CD is finally out and available on Bridge Records. Clara's "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KJTGNI?tag=thereminvox-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;creativeASIN=B000KJTGNI&amp;creative=373489&amp;camp=211189" target="_blank">Lost Theremin Album</a>", which truth be told was really just lost in Bob Moog's basement, comprises the additional material recorded by Bob and Shirleigh during the same July 1975 sessions that produced Clara's first album "The Art of the Theremin".</p>
<p>While Moog was delighted with our plans to finally release this material (just prior to his taking ill), we were only able to locate and retrieve these 5-track reel to reel tapes after he died (thanks to Mike Adams).</p>
<p>Of the 5 tracks, two were primarily theremin, two were primarily piano, and the fifth was only theremin from a direct electronic hookup to the instrument. Aside from a few false starts and maybe 5 retakes, the entire 2 albums worth of music was recorded straight through without break, and without any edits. What you hear is pure unadulterated Clara and Nadia.</p>
<p>Well, almost. Dad had the tapes digitized and re-mastered at Sony Studios, and added a few extra parts (guitar in Estrellita, strings in Pastoral, and 8 cellos in Bachianas). He worked long and hard on this project, overseeing every aspect, and if I say so myself, he did a brilliant job.</p>
<p>This CD sounds amazing, and our whole family is very proud of this effort. Clara, Nadia, Bob Moog, and Lev Sergeyevich would all have been very proud as well. And if I may add a personal note, NO one would have been more proud than Clara's beloved Bob Rockmore.</p>
<p>The Bridge Records website is <a href="http://www.bridgerecords.com/" target="_blank">www.bridgerecords.com</a>-- their links to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KJTGNI?tag=thereminvox-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;creativeASIN=B000KJTGNI&amp;creative=373489&amp;camp=211189" target="_blank">amazon.com</a> or <a href="http://arkivmusic.com/" target="_blank">arkivmusic.com</a> will be up shortly, they tell me. The play list is below.</p>
<p>Enjoy -- I really look forward to your feedback and thoughts.</p>
<p>Peace, Steve</p>
