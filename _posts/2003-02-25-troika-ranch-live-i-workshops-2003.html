<p>New York City based dance theater company Troika Ranch will present its Live-Interactive (Live-I) Workshop, an intensive seminar for artists and advanced students who want to explore the use of interactive computer technology in the creation and performance of dance, theater, and related live artworks.</p>
<p>Led by composer/media artist Mark Coniglio and choreographer Dawn Stoppiello, Artistic Co-Directors of Troika Ranch, the workshop gives the participants the opportunity to experiment with technological tools and sensors that allow their gestures and vocalizations to interactively control video, sound, light and other computer controllable media. Participants will be given an introduction to the tools and the techniques required to use them as they create short studies over the course of the workshop. This work will be complimented by critical discussions regarding how the use of media and technology shapes the form and content of the artwork.</p>
<p>There will be three workshops this year:</p>
<p>* A week-long workshop in April, targeted for local artists<br />
* A one-day intensive in May, free to ten Brooklyn based artists<br />
* A two-week long workshop in June</p>
<p>The April workshop is targeted for artists local to New York City, as it will consist of one intensive weekend plus three separate weekday evenings.</p>
<p>The free May workshop is an day-long intensive, designed to serve as an introduction to the tools and techniques for integrating interactive technology into artworks. This workshop is open to Brooklyn based artists only.</p>
<p>One scholarship for a Brooklyn based artist is available for the June workshop. It will be awarded to an artist who exhibits strong potential and significant need. Artists who wish to be considered _must_ attend the free workshop in May.</p>
<p>Both the free workshop and the scholarship are made possible by generous support from the Brooklyn Arts Council.</p>
<p>Specific details about each of the workshops, and information on how to apply, can be found below.</p>

We are very pleased to announce that the June workshop will be held at the new Dance Theater Workshop in Manhattan this year.

<p>One scholarship for a Brooklyn based artist is available for the June workshop. It will be awarded to an artist who exhibits strong potential and significant need. Artists who wish to be considered for this scholarship _must_ attend the free workshop in May. (See above.)</p>
<p>You do not need to attend both weeks. But, if you would like to attend the second half, you must either 1) attend the first week, or 2) have taken one of our workshops in the past.</p>
<p>If you plan to attend the first or second week only, the cost is US$400. If you plan to attend both weeks, then the cost is US$800.</p>
<h3>APPLICATION</h3>
<p>Registration for the Live-I Workshop is limited. Only ten participants can be accepted for each week long session.</p>
<p>To apply, please send or email Troika Ranch (see contact information below) one paragraph explaining why you are interested in attending the workshop and one paragraph describing the kind of work that you make. You should also briefly tell us about your level of expertise with computers. Please include your name, address, telephone number and email address.</p>
<p>Priority for the first week of the June workshop will be given to those who have not taken our workshop before. Applicants for the second week will be considered on an equal basis.</p>
<p>If you live in Brooklyn and would like to be considered for the scholarship for the June workshop, please let us know on your application. Note: You _must_ attend the May workshop to be placed into consideration for scholarship for the June workshop.</p>
<p>We will be selecting ten participants for each workshop. The deadline for the April workshop is March 7th, for June it is April 15th. You will be notified of your acceptance no later than one week after the deadline. Participants for the free May one-day intensive workshop will be chosen on a first come, first served basis.</p>
<p>Note: Early acceptance for those who would be travelling from a country outside the United States may be possible -- please email us about this.</p>
<p>NOTE: It is strongly recommended that you bring your own laptop computer (Mac or PC) if possible. We have a limited number of computers for use by the workshop participants. If you cannot bring your own computer, you may be required to share a computer with one other participant. In addition, if you can bring a digital video camera, you will find it useful. If you are able to bring your own computer, please let us know the type, speed, and whether or not it has a FireWire (aka iLink) port.</p>
<h3>A NOTE ABOUT THE SELECTION PROCESS</h3>
<p>Please know that, beyond your application information, an important factor in choosing those ten people is how the group fits together as a whole. When the skills of those participating varies too widely, it means that someone ends up either bored or overwhelmed. So please understand that if you are not chosen it is not a reflection on your abilities or your skills as an artist.</p>
