    Thanks for an informative article. It has given me lot's of names to follow up on.
    I am a painter and teach Colour and 2D Design at an art college and am researching for a section on synaesthesia for my classes. I'm really looking forward to exposing the students (and myself) to some experimental music to go along with the abstract painting that we will explore.
    cheers

    Nicole,

    I have just given a talk at the MET as part of the Art Beyond Sight Multimodal Approaches to Learning, Creativity and Communication on ArtMusic. I would be interested to hear what you think of my approach. You can view and listen to a number of art works as music at www.drsrl.com/artmusic.

    Regards,

    Marty Quinn

  content: I am a synesthesiac with perfect pitch, and I always see different notes
    as colours, not keys. For example, a C major chord consists of a C - red/yellow,
    E - pink, and a G - brown. When I hear this chord, I see all of these colours
    ina picture that I can't describe. It has been very interesting to see how other
    people conceive things, and also how they can find it difficult to describe. I
    also see the texture of sounds; a c major chord played quite long on a stringed
    instrument reminds me of something in a very sticky substance, amber or resin,
    for example.

    i also experience notes and sounds as 'textures' and sometimes colors. Dm is a deep midnight blue, Dmaj more purple in hue. the 'textures' are akin to a 'feeling on the skin' but on some other skin that doesn't exist - somehow outside of spatial dimension.

    the curious thing, for me, is that these effects generally only occur at high volume levels, or intensities. and they are not neccessarily 'logical' at all: the white needle of a test pattern whine is somehow also blunt and smooth and chrome and cool.

    somehow, somehow: this has led me to a love of noise music and experimental artists who work with high-volume soundscapes. i just hope i don't go deaf anytime soon ;)

    yea
    i dunno
    when i hear an individual note
    i see a flurry of colors that act in different ways
    like
    a low E flat
    i see a flashing of lights
    and i feel weightless and extra heavy at the same time
    but as soon as i hear more notes together
    like in a song
    in my mind
    i see places
    these places are usually more vivid than the real world
    but i can't help but wonder if i really have synesthesia
    or if i just have a wild imagination

    I can never pinpoint the exact color of the notes i hear and they usually mix with sort of image that is difficult to describe.

    When distortion or overdrive is added to guitars, i get this static or grainy type of image. this is the only somewhat describable image and it varies from degree of overdrive to degree.

    It's not only color, but i "see" the sound or note. If something is played on a violin, i see the note drawn out and i usually see it in a tan color.

    Piano notes seem to have a more percussive and black and white image to them, like the keys.

    High to mid-range guitar notes are almost always yellow and the guitar screech from Jimi Hendrix's "Foxy Lady" is very purple and grainy with overdrive.

    bass guitars have colors in the black to purple range, incorporating other dark yellow tones as well.

    This is the best description i can give. It's really impossible to communicate the "sensation" or "image" that reflects the music but there's definitely something weird about it.

    It makes music more interesting and adds "dimension".

    I have just found out about this wonderful thing called synaesthesia and i think it is beautiful the way you picture songs colers places and things. I found out about this just yesterday and i am eager to learn more about it all. I read the book " A Mango Shaped Place" and typed up synaethesia to learn more about it and came across this.

    i am speechless

    give u examples:piano:white/guitar:yellow/flute:pink and im sure there is blue
    and green and i can give you the colour of the sound exactly/and there is some
    sounds composed of 2 or 3 coloures and i can see the picture of the musical sentence
    clearely thats why i can play any musical sentence while i cant read the notes
    of music how can i help?i can differentiate between these coloures without any
    confusion in the degree of the colour for example i can find the pink colour degree
    not any pink which is in some instruments become darker in the higher octave in
    some instruments but the colour become lighter in the other instrument

    Hey whats up!

    My name is Huw Clarke from Wales in the UK and I recently discovered that i have this version of synasthesia, I am doing a major creative project on it this year for my final year at university studying popular music. Could i ask for some peoples e-mail addresses cos i would absolutely find it so helpful if i could speak to some of you about your versions of it, the colours/textures you see so you could contribute to my work so to say.

    My address is hellchild_66618@hotmail.com if anyone wants to add me.

    Thank you

    Wow, it's good to know I am no the only one.

    I developed a musical linked Synesthesia after an accident many years ago. It took me 15 years to realise it was not just me.... That was only three years ago. Never told anyone as I thought they would not understand until 3 years ago.

    I first realised it when I told a friend how good an LP looked???

    My Synesthesia turns on and off dependent on whether I open or shut my eyes. It is difficult to explain as "sight would be to explain to someone that cannot see". Anyway.... I see a range of varying colours in soft and sharp shapes, but unlike some of you the colour and shape is determined by volume and depth of the music. For example, electric guitar is generally sharpe and bright in colour, such as yellow and a bass guitar deep purple and rounded.

    I cannot read music as the notes dance around when music is playing but I can learn to play instruments fairly easily.

    This may sound stupid, but does anyone think this makes them more "understanding" or "deeper thinking"?

    I like the opening and shutting your eyes thing.... I wish mine was that way. When I play its happening always. It can be more prevalent when I close my eyes but as I mentioned before I "feel" the colors and much as hear them. Its a color that has a feeling and a texture.... make sense??

    On stage one summer night playing the Jones Beach Theater Long Island I hit a chord I gravitate to but added a 9th on the lower register. It had a tone that resonated my equipment and me. I saw 10,000 people illuminate like a bursting firework and I felt the heart Chakra release breath taking like emotion. The night sky turned indigo blue while my guitar felt like it was more fluid than solid. And NO I do not take any drugs....not even aspirin LOL!
    It was not a singled out experience. It has happened under less dynamic circumstances as well. The simple meeting of a person and their voice has caused similar events. Not very often, but it has happened. I met a woman whos voice and color upon meeting triggered a smell that I could not mistake. Fortunately it was a good aroma, and for me (as I keep mentioning) I could feel the smell and it resided in me with good emotion. Are you still with me? LMAO!

    All the best!

    I also have synesthesia, and I understand what you mean. Half the time I need to have my eyes closed to actually see the colours and patterns, but then other times I can also see it with my eyes open. If I can't see it with my eyes open, I can generally 'sense' the colours around me and such. Does anyone else experience it like that?

    And sorry if this is messy, I am new to this forum thing and don't know if this is how I reply to a post xD

    Scale systems seem to have a second, latent tonal center

    If you graph where the various tones are in any given scale, most of them have a surprise in store for you. Their pattern of placement will nearly always be symmetrical, yet the axis of symmetry will seldom go through the tonic. It seems that most scales have, in essence, two tonics: one for each of the brain's hemispheres. Erasmus Darwin seems to have been right on the cusp of discovering what lies at the heart of much of music's affective power. His system of tone-color correspondence places Green at D, the note which is right on the axis of symmetry for the C major scale. And putting Green at the axis makes sense, as Green is right in the middle of the visible spectrum, perfectly placed for anchoring a symmetrical tone-color palette.

  content: Wow this is so interesting. I think I have a mild form of this. I have
    always associated written music notes with particular colours, which also correspond
    to the respective piano keys. I was stunned to read the reasons why D is green
    (it has always been green for me!) and I too see C as yellow, E as pink and G
    as brown! Incredible to discover others see it the same way.

    LOVEY KATE! I dont see the same colors but thats common among Syneths.... As I mentioned in my writing above I see F as green... we could never write music because our color representation would be having us playing different chords and notes! LOLOL

    Do you still see the same color when its an octave higher? And what about harmonics? I begin to see a variegated gradient once we are outside standard tuning.

    i believe that i have this also , my first experience was about a year and a half ago maybe two. i was at my friends house and he and another friend were playing Tony hawks skate when i came over, i was just sitting there when i felt really weird and i couldnt be in the same room as them,and these are good friends of mine. i went into the other room and picked up a guitar then started playing. all of a sudden it just hit me as i was playing. i felt something that felt like the perfect pitch it sounded that way to not matter what i did, and the color red slowly filled my vision.
    i wasn't looking down either or i would have tried to recreate what i was playing. but i was to distracted by this blast of color that filled my eyes.

    the only way i can portrey it is:

    take a mental picture of everything in your line of vision, and take in the periferals also, now let red slowly mix in that picture until you see nothing but the color of a bright neon red.

    my second experience was when i was talking to a counselor and as we conversed everything turned green. i just let it go and felt fine as we were talking, i thought it was just lack of sleep or something normal.

    i seem to be able to trigger the color black through silence aka static.

    does this mean that i am a synesthete?

    either way right now i am eightteen, trying to get money to go to school for music so that i can teach music or guitar. and move into music therapy in the future where i might be able to find the answers to synesthesia.

    i cant trigger it through music willingly, yet, but i hope to in the future so that every one and myself can experience this through my music.

    if your a researcher and interested in talking leave a comment ill be checking back to this.

    There is a lot to be learned about this and I dont know if it just shows up in your life unless a traumatic accident has occurred. That we know is an invariable that causes or creates a lot of awakenings.
    I always has synesthesia. I see colors in music, letters and numbers and people and things. I also have an emotional attachments (feeling) that can occur with them. I never learned notes or any traditional means of musical education. I felt and saw colors ever since I could understand the enjoyment of sound. And all sound has a color feeling and flavor. Peoples voices, intruments, noise etc. Music is a cascading fireworks show and you move through gradients of color rapidly and with great emotion. (for me)
    I was a touring guitar player for 12 years and I wrote as well for many acts. I play by emotion and color not by notes and time, and I write by means of colors and feelings as well. For instance I dont play a G chord after the D because it musically is correct or sounds right, I play it because it feels correct as does the color. F is a key I like to use and the color in the lower harmonics is like an emerald green. Harmonics change colors for me, and I believe that the Fibonacci Sequence is somehow tied into the way synesthesia works in our brain. Thats a whole other level...LOL
    Im also paint and take photography on a pro level. Again, I use both the brush and the camera when I "feel" the picture or color, not see it. I dont choose a color on the palette I just paint and begin combining emotions until I like was my eyes feel...LOLOL. Its nuts I know... but I dont know another way.

    I also have the common cross wiring of seeing colors in numbers and letters.... A is red, 3 is black and equations equal a color not a numeric result ETC. Its something you need to understand and use to your advantage with help of others. Otherwise you can easily become a misfit in the world. Embrace it, learn about it, and express it. Art is the best means of creating something from what you have. MANY are artists or become one. I struggled for years, then found how music allowed me to be "normal" in my own skin. I evolved quickly and became something others could not due to my perception of how I approach things. My unique view and ability of creating gave me an unprecedented edge that I used to flourish not fail. Billy Joel has Synesthesia as well as many impressive artists in music, paint, poetry and more.

    Thanks for allowing me to share here. Be well all!

<p><a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/86/1/16/index.html" target="_blank">Synaesthesia</a> is the general name for a related set of various cognitive states having in common that stimuli to one sense, such as smell, are involuntarily simultaneously perceived as if by one or more other senses, such as sight or / and hearing (see <a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/33/9/5.html#cytowic1989" target="_blank">Cytowic 1989</a>; <a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/33/9/5.html#baron" target="_blank">Baron-Cohen &amp; Harrison 1993</a>). For example, the sounds of musical instruments might make you see certain colors, each color specific and consistent with the particular instrument playing; a piano, for example, might produces a sky-blue cloud, and a tenor saxophone produce an image of electric purple neon lights. One highly documented case of synaesthesia involved Michael O. Watson, who felt at or within his right hand different flavors -- the flavor of spearmint, for example, felt like cool smooth glass columns (see <a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/33/9/5.html#cytowic1993" target="_blank">Cytowic 1989, 1993</a>).</p>
<p>Synaesthesia is additive; that is, it adds to the initial (primary) sensory perception, rather than replacing one perceptual mode for another. For example, with synaesthetically colored musical instruments, you both hear and "see" the sounds; the visual images do not replace the audial sensations. Both sensory perceptions may thus become affected and altered in the ways they function and integrate with other senses. Synaesthesia is generally "one-way"; that is, for example, for a given synaesthete, tastes may produce synaesthetic sounds, but sounds will not produce synaesthetic. However, there have been a few rare cases of «bi-directional» synaesthesia, in which, for example, music induces (synaesthetic) colors and seeing colors induces (synaesthetic) sounds -- the correspondences, however, are not the same in both directions!</p>
<p>Synaesthesia may be divided into two general, somewhat overlapping types. The first, "synaesthesia proper", is as described above, in which stimuli to a sensory input will also trigger sensations in one or more other sensory modes. With the second form of synaesthesia, certain sets of things which our individual cultures teach us to put together and categorize in some specific way -- like letters, numbers, or people's names -- also get some kind of sensory addition, such as a smell, color or flavor. The most common forms of cognitive synaesthesia involve such things as colored written letter characters (graphemes), numbers, time units, and musical notes or keys. For example, the synaesthete might see, about a foot or two before her (the majority of synaesthetes – about 70% -- are female), different colors for different spoken vowel and consonant sounds, or perceive numbers and letters, whether conceptualized or before her in print, as colored.<br />
<!--nextpage--><br />
Let us now explore a little bit of the history of synesthesia in music:</p>
<p>It might seem an odd thing to start such a history with a look at ancient mathematicians and astronomers, but some of them offered important initial cornerstones to later theories on synaesthesia. Around the year 550 B.C., to begin with, the Pythagoreans offered mathematical equations for the musical scales, showing that musical notes could be seen as relationships between numbers. A musical scale, for example, could be divided into eight notes, an "octave" scale, which repeats its sequence as the musical notes proceeded higher or lower. To use a basic example, this could be the C-Major scale on the piano, consisting of just the white keys: C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C. This is also the basic "do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do".</p>
<p>Almost 200 years later, around 370 B.C. or so, <a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/74/1/5/index.html" target="_blank">Plato</a> wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1585100072?tag=thereminvox-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;creativeASIN=1585100072&amp;creative=373489&amp;camp=211189" target="_blank">Timaeus</a>, in which the soul of the world is described as having these same musical ratios. A cosmology was emerging in which the planets' radii (the planets' order actually varied, depending upon the author) were set with a ratio sequence of 1:2:3:4:8:9. Later, ratios would emerge with the following ratio sequence: Moon = 1; Venus = 2; Earth = 3; Mars = 4; Jupiter = 14; Saturn = 25. This sequence approximated the Greek diatonic musical scale's ratios, thus the planets were tied to music, and a concept of "the music of the spheres" was initiated.</p>

<p>Shortly after Plato, around 350 B.C., <a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/76/1/16/index.html" target="_blank">Aristotle</a> wrote to maintain that the harmony of colors were like the harmony of sounds. This set the stage for a later equating of specific light and sound frequencies, as Aristotle's works were translated and incorporated into European sciences. At about this same time, <a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/75/1/5/index.html" target="_blank">Archytas of Tarentus</a> (c. 428 – 350 B.C.) introduced the «chromatic» (12-tone) scale to Greece. This was seen as a compliment to the two main scales: the diatonic (a whole-note or full-tone scale); and the enharmonic (quarter-tones). Around 1492, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0300054971?tag=thereminvox-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;creativeASIN=0300054971&amp;creative=373489&amp;camp=211189" target="_blank">Franchino Gaffurio</a> was re-introducing colorized Greek modal music to Europe, with the following system: Dorian = «crystalline» color; Phrygian = orange; Lydian = red; and Mixolydian = an «undefined mixed color» (which is, admittedly, somewhat vague). By the late 1580’s, the painter <a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/78/1/16/index.html" target="_blank">Giuseppe Arcimboldo</a> was formally equating «dark» with high pitches and white with low pitches (see <a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/33/9/5.html#dann" target="_blank">Dann 1998</a>) – which is the reverse of the more «normal» trend of low being dark and high being white. <a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/77/1/16/index.html" target="_blank">Athanasius Kircher</a>, around 1646, developed a system of correspondences between musical intervals and colors, based basically upon complex traditional symbolisms, as follows:</p>

<p>In 1704, Sir <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton" target="_blank">Isaac Newton</a>'s treatise Optics (<a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/33/9/5.html#newton" target="_blank">Newton 1952 (1704)</a>) was first published, which dealt, among other things, with the parallel between colors of the spectrum and notes of the musical scale.</p>

<p>In a sense, this was a revival of Aristotle's theories of the resemblances between light and sound; but Newton's efforts were far more elaborate and mathematical. Newton mathematically but quite arbitrarily divided the visible light spectrum into seven colors. He then noted that the mathematical relationships of these seven colors was similar to those of the musical scale, with the following concordances:</p>

<p>Although Newton himself basically only held these concordances as an analogy, and later discarded notions that there was any true connection between colors and the musical scale, by around 1742, the French Jesuit monk <a href="http://26.1911encyclopedia.org/C/CA/CASTEL_LOUIS_BERTRAND.htm" target="_blank">Louis Bertrand Castel</a>, the well-known mathematician and physicist, was a firm advocate of there being direct solid relationships between the seven colors and the seven units of the scale, as per Newton's Optics. Castel proposed the construction of a clavecin oculaire, a light-keyboard, as a new musical instrument which would simultaneously produce both sound and the "correct" associated color for each note (see <a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/33/9/5.html#galeyev1988" target="_blank">Galeyev 1988</a>; <a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/33/9/5.html#dann" target="_blank">Dann 1998</a>; <a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/33/9/5.html#ricco" target="_blank">Riccò 1999</a>). This theme was returned to in 1790, when <a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/79/1/16/index.html" target="_blank">Erasmus Darwin</a> (Charles Darwin's grandfather) wrote about the parallel between colors and musical notes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/81/1/16/index.html" target="_blank">Alexander Scriabin</a> probably was not a synesthete, but, rather, was highly influenced by the French and Russian salon fashions. Most noticeably, Scriabin seems to have been strongly influenced by the writings and talks of the Russian mystic, Helena P. Blavatsky, founder of The Theosophical Society and author of such works as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0766126013?tag=thereminvox-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;creativeASIN=0766126013&amp;creative=373489&amp;camp=211189" target="_blank">Isis Unveiled and The Secret Doctrine</a> (see <a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/33/9/5.html#dann" target="_blank">Dann 1998)</a>. The synesthetic motifs found in Scriabin’s compositions – most noticeably in Prometheus, composed in 1911 – are developed off of ideas from Newton, and follow a basic mathematical musical algorithm, called a circle of fifths (see ???; ???; and, of course, ???). The score of ??? contains a line designated «Luce»; this was for a light organ, playing two lines: one to correspond to Scriabin’s concepts of the «correct» colors for each musical key, as he modulated from key to key; the other, to counter the first lines colors. Scriabin and others were unable to realize a light-music performance of Prometheus until its premier performance in New York, in 1915, where, rather than using a color organ, colored light was projected onto a screen set above the orchestra performers’ heads, using a system designed by Preston S. Millar, W.F. Little, and William McKay (see ???).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/82/1/16/index.html" target="_blank">Amy Beach</a> (1867-1944), American pianist and composer, who flourished c. 1900 - 1920's, was unquestionably a true synesthete. It turns out that Beach had both perfect pitch and a set of colors for musical keys.</p>
<p>"Other interesting stories about Amy's musical personality and her astounding abilities as a prodigy are recounted in almost all previous biographical writings. One such story is Amy's association of certain colors with certain keys. For instance, Amy might ask her mother to play the 'purple music' or the 'green music.' The most popular story, however, seems to be the one about Amy's going on a trip to California and notating on staff paper the exact pitches of bird calls she heard" (<a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/33/9/5.html#brown" target="_blank">Brown 1994: 16</a>).</p>
<p>"Amy's mother encouraged her to relate melodies to the colors blue, pink, or purple, but before long Amy had a wider range of colors, which she associated with certain major keys. Thus C was white, F-sharp black, E yellow, G red, A green, A-flat blue, D-flat violet or purple, and E-flat pink. Until the end of her life she associated these colors with those keys" (<a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/33/9/5.html#jenkins" target="_blank">Jenkins 1994: 5-6</a>).<!--nextpage--></p>

<p>In 1911, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti penned his Manifesto of Futurism. In my opinion, if there was ever a group of non-synesthete artists who pushed the boundaries of synesthetic arts, it was Marinetti and his Futurist colleagues such as Luigi Colombo Fillìa, Enrico Prampolini, and Giacomo Balla. They were known chiefly for staging grand banquets (see <a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/33/9/5.html#marinetti" target="_blank">Marinetti 1989 (1932)</a>). Marinetti’s intent was to have all the senses (he counted five) employed in interactive synesthetic ecstasy.</p>
<p>The Futurists composed a manifesto regarding painting:</p>
<p>«We Futurists therefore claim that in bringing the elements of sound, noise and smell to painting we are opening fresh paths. We have already taught artists to love our essentially dynamic modern life with its sounds, noises and smells, thereby destroying the stupid passion for values which are solemn, academic, serene, hieratic and mummified: everything purely intellectual, in fact. Imagination without strings, words-in-freedom, the systematic use of onomatopoeia, antigraceful music without rhythmic quadrature, and the art of noises—these were created by the same Futurist sensibility that has given birth to the painting of sounds, noises and smells.</p>
<p>«It is indisputably true that (1) silence is static and sounds, noises and smells are dynamic; (2) sounds, noises and smells are nothing but different forms and intensities of vibration; and (3) any succession of sounds, noises and smells impresses on the mind an arabesque of form and color. We must measure this intensity and perceive these arabesques.</p>
<p>«The painting of sounds, noises and smells rejects:</p>
<ol>
<li>All muted colors, even those obtained directly and without using tricks like patinas and glazes.</li>
<li>The banality of those velvets, silks and flesh tints which are too human, too refined, too soft, and flowers which are too pale and drooping.</li>
<li>Greys, browns and all muddy colors.</li>
<li>The use of pure horizontal and vertical lines, and all other dead lines.</li>
<li>The right angle, which we consider passionless.</li>
<li>The cube, the pyramid and all other static shapes.</li>
<li>The unities of time and place.</li>
</ol>
<p>«The painting of sounds, noises and smells calls for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reds, rrrrreds, the rrrrrreddest rrrrrrreds that shouuuuuuut.</li>
<li>Greens, that can never be greener, greeeeeeeeeeeens that screeeeeeam, yellows, as violent as can be: polenta yellows, saffron yellows, brass yellows.</li>
<li>All the colors of speed, of joy, of carousings and fantastic carnivals, of fireworks, cafe-chantants and music-halls; all colors seen in movement, colors experienced in time and not in space.</li>
<li>The dynamic arabesque, which is the sole reality created by the artist in the depths of his feeling.</li>
<li>The clash of all the acute angles, which we have already called the angles of will.</li>
<li>Oblique lines which fall on the observer like so many bolts from the blue, along with lines of depth.</li>
<li>The sphere, the ellipse that spins, the upside-down cone, the spiral and all the dynamic forms which the infinite powers of an artist’s genius are able to uncover.</li>
<li>Perspective obtained not as the objectivity of distances but as a subjective interpenetration of hard and soft, sharp and dull forms.</li>
<li>As a universal subject and as the sole reason for a painting’s existence: the significance of its dynamic construction (polyphonic architectural whole). Architecture is usually thought of as something static; this is wrong. What we have in mind is an architecture similar to the dynamic musical architecture achieved by the Futurist musician Pratella. Architecture is found in the movement of colors, of smoke from a chimney, and in metallic structures, when they are experienced in a violent, chaotic state of mind.</li>

<p><a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/83/1/16/index.html" target="_blank">Kandinsky</a>, working in the 1920’s, was also not a synesthete, despite his fame for his synesthetic artwork. Many of his paintings and stage pieces were based upon a set and established system of correspondences between colors and the timbres of specific musical instruments. Kandinsky himself, however, stated that his correspondences between colors and musical timbres has no «scientific» basis, but was founded upon a combination of his own personal feelings, current prevailing cultural biases, and mysticism (see <a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/33/9/5.html#kandinsky" target="_blank">Kandinsky 1994</a>; see also <a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/33/9/5.html#dann" target="_blank">Dann 1998</a>; <a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/33/9/5.html#ricco" target="_blank">Riccò 1999: 138-142</a>).</p>

<p>Sir <a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/84/1/16/index.html" target="_blank">Arthur Bliss</a>, who wrote his Colour Symphony in 1922, was not a synesthete. He was simply yet another influenced by the ideas of «color music», although, for him, it did not come with the trappings of mystic religions, but, rather, with British traditions. The symphony features four movements: Purple; Red; Blue; and Green. Bliss based this work upon the symbolism generally associated with the colors in traditional English heraldry, along the following lines: «Purple – Amethysts, Pageantry, Royalty – and Death; Red – Rubies, Wine, Furnaces, Magic, …; Blue – Sapphires, Deep Water, Skies, Loyalty, Melancholy; Green – Emeralds, Hope, Youth, Joy, Spring, and Victory» (<a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/33/9/5.html#dannatt" target="_blank">Dannatt 1991</a>).</p>
<p>Around 1925, Alexander László, Hungarian musician and composer (born in 1895) composed a small set of Lichtmusik (light-music) pieces, including Eleven preludes (opus 10). Eleven preludes had the following scheme: 1. ultramarine; 2. yellow; 3. violet; 4. leaf-green; 5. grey; 6. red; 7. ice-blue; 8. white; 9. sea-green; 10. cress; 11. black. It is quite questionable as to whether László was a synaesthete; my current guess is that he probably was not.</p>

<p>Also in the 1920’s, Danish-born <a href="http://www.gis.net/%7Escatt/clavilux/clavilux.html" target="_blank">Thomas Wilfred</a> came to the United States, became involved with the Theosophist movement, and designed and built a «color organ» which he named the Clavilux. He named the art-form produced «Lumia». He toured the U.S. and Europe, giving concerts. Likewise, Mary Hallock Greenewalt developed a color-organ which she named the Sarabet, on which she also gave concerts (see <a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/33/9/5.html#moritz" target="_blank">Moritz 2000</a>).<!--nextpage--></p>

<p>Composer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivier_Messiaen" target="_blank">Olivier Messiaen</a>, who flourished in the 1940’s, on the other hand, was more likely a synesthete; the question is raised quite well in his own writings and in interviews (see <a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/33/9/5.html#samuel" target="_blank">Samuel 1994</a>). Many of his compositions, such as Couleurs de la cité céleste, L’ascension, and Des canyons aux étoiles, are directly based upon his, in a sense, trying to "produce pictures» via sound, writing specific notes to produce specific color sequences and blends.</p>
<p>In 1940, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Studios" target="_blank">Walt Disney studios</a> presented <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasia" target="_blank">Fantasia</a>. One of the main themes of this animation film was to put pictures to pieces of orchestral music – in a sense, an early version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV" target="_blank">MTV</a>. The results, however, did not produce much in the way of synesthetically motivated art – with the noticeable exceptions of the opening piece, the abstract colors accompanying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach" target="_blank">J.S. Bach</a>’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toccata_and_Fugue_in_D_Minor" target="_blank">Toccata and Fugue in d-minor</a>. More direct to synesthesia, but constantly overlooked in the movie Fantasia, is the short divertissement section featuring an animated oscilloscope-like «sound track» which presented shapes and colors for various instruments. These colors and shapes bear some similarities to the types of actual perceptions colored-music synesthetes experience.</p>

<p>In the late 1940’s, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Fischinger" target="_blank">Oskar Fischinger</a> developed a color-organ which he named the Lumigraph, on which he gave a few performances (see <a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/33/9/5.html#moritz" target="_blank">Moritz 2000</a>).</p>
<p>In 1989, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Davis" target="_blank">Miles Davis</a> presented his album, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004WK3E?tag=thereminvox-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;creativeASIN=B00004WK3E&amp;creative=373489&amp;camp=211189" target="_blank">Aura</a>, which is a suite of 10 modern jazz pieces each set upon a color. Aura was composed by Palle Mikkelborg, who was not a synesthete. The composer was aware of the concept of synesthesia, but only slightly. The correspondences made between the musical styles and particular colors is basically based upon western-European – and more so, on North American – culture. Furthermore, the associations are fairly «loose»; the colors are arranged in a certain sequence, and the musical pieces of the suite flow in a certain arrangement, but there is not strong attempt to have the two sequences correspond.</p>
<p>In 1990, Russian composer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofia_Gubaidulina" target="_blank">Sofia Gubaidulina</a> composed Alleluja, which includes an optional part for color keyboard.</p>
<p>Composer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Torke" target="_blank">Michael Torke</a>, on the other hand, is definitely a synesthete, reporting that one of his types is colored time units (days of the week, years, and such). Torke composed Color Music in 1991. He is currently on contract with Walt Disney studios to write music for films.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_376" align="aligncenter" width="589"]<a href="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2001/02/Manu_Katche_by_Stuart_Mentiply.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-376" alt="Manu Katché (Photo: Stuart Mentiply)." src="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2001/02/Manu_Katche_by_Stuart_Mentiply.jpg" width="589" height="400" /></a> Manu Katché (Photo: Stuart Mentiply).[/caption]</p>
<p>French drummer Manu Katché is a synesthete who synesthetically sees things to music and sound stimulation. He has performed with such musicians as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Gabriel" target="_blank">Peter Gabriel</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Satriani" target="_blank">Joe Satriani</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tori_Amos" target="_blank">Tori Amos</a>. As I currently write, he is on tour with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sting_%28music%29" target="_blank">Sting</a>.</p>
<p>Currently world-famous oboist Jennifer Paull wrote to me: "I am a musician and publisher. I have been motivated my entire life by a rainbow of colours which do not belong to the limited, conventional rainbow -- but are totally real for me. I cannot put them into words. There are rainbows of textures, rainbows of moods and feelings too. The first moment I heard the timbre of the oboe d'amore, I knew that I had to play it and I have spent my life doing so. . . . I found out that I saw things differently when I was 11. My best friend was totally bored by my saying letters and numbers represented colours. She noted everything I said and tried to trip me up. Of course, she couldn't. «[Regarding the sound of the oboe d’amore], I cannot put into words. I can feel it, see it, but I can't put it into words. This sound -- this colour -- took me over. I had no choice.»</p>
<p>This is only a most basic of overviews of synesthetic themes in the various arts – barely scratching the surface. Suffice to say that, currently, such concepts abound, and there is no dearth of artists employing such ideas in their work, particularly nowadays. Present day true synesthete artists, however, are quite a bit rarer, and are hard to point out, particularly since the diagnosis is still not common, resulting indirectly in most synesthetes not talking about their special perceptions.<!--nextpage--></p>
