<p><i>You Asked For It</i> was a human-interest show that aired between 1950 and 1959. For the first few months, it was named <i>The Art Baker Show</i>, after the series creator and host, Art Baker. In April of 1951, the show's title was changed to <i>You Asked For It</i>. <span class="smalltext">[Wikipedia]</span></p>
<p>In 1952 the show featured Samuel Hoffman playing "a dance melody that he recently recorded for Capitol Records", as Art Baker said presenting him.</p>
<p>The quality of the video is very bad, nonetheless is a precious and rare document of Sam Hoffman and his unique style.</p>
