<p><b>Otto Luening</b> is an early pioneer of electronic music. His Tape Music, including A Poem in Cycles &amp; Bells, Gargoyles for Violin &amp; Synthesized Sound, and Sounds of New Music demonstrated the early potential of synthesizers and special editing techniques for so-called classical music.</p>
