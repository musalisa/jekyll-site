<p>Erasmus Darwin (December 12, 1731 - April 18, 1802) trained as a physician and wrote extensively on medicine and botany, as well as poetry. Living in Birmingham and Lichfield, England. He was one of the founder members of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Society" target="_blank">Lunar Society</a>.</p>
<p>He was born near Nottingham, and studied at Cambridge and Edingurgh. He practised medicine in Lichfield in Staffordshire for twenty years; George III invited him to be royal physician but he declined.</p>
<p>His book Zoonomia (1794-6) is widely considered to foreshadow the pre-Darwinian theories of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, and maybe even the theory of evolution formulated by his grandson <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin" target="_blank">Charles Darwin</a>. Another of his grandsons was Francis Galton. His experiments in galvanism inspired Mary Shelley to write Frankenstein.</p>
<p>His poetry was admired by Coleridge and Wordsworth; and often made reference to his interests in science, for example botany and steam engines. His most famous work of poetry was The Botanic Garden.</p>
<p>He was in inventor of several devices, though did not patent any of them. One was a horizontal windmill, which he design for Josiah Wedgwood (who would be Charles Darwin's other grandfather).</p>
<p>He is remebered by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Society_Moonstones" target="_blank">Moonstones</a> in Birmingham.</p>
