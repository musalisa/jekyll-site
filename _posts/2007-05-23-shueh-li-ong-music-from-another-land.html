<p><i>An interview with polystrumentist, singer and composer Shueh-li Ong.</i></p>
<p>“Music From Another Land” is not the typical “theremin album” you'd expect from musicians like Lydia Kavina, Pamelia Kurstin or Peter Pringle, to name a few. Although there is good amount of well played theremin, it just doesn't play the leading role.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_669" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/Shueh-li-Ong-01.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-669" alt="Shueh-li Ong with her synthesizers, Theremin and Guqin" src="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/Shueh-li-Ong-01.jpg" width="600" height="338" /></a> Shueh-li Ong with her synthesizers, Theremin and Guqin.[/caption]</p>
<p>In fact, the feeling I got while listening to this CD from the very first time is that there isn't a main character because the leading role is played by the music itself as a whole, as it happens in a band whose members have strong personalities but they play very well together, producing an overall sound that please your ears and your soul.</p>
<p>Except that, in this case, we have, for the most part, a one woman band, playing alone in the studio with electronic gear but with the live performance always in mind.</p>
<p>And that reflects the multi-talented and eclectic personality of Shueh-li Ong, a polystrumentist, composer, singer, programmer, arranger and producer, at her ease both with digital synthesizers and the guqin (a traditional chinese instrument 3000 years old); a musician able to learn to master a very difficult instrument like the theremin and to manage the technicalities of the recording studio in a creative way.</p>
<p>The result is a fresh and fun electronica album, with catchy tunes and very good arrangements, very good vocals and very good theremin parts. And one thing that hit me is that this album is very well produced (it sounds good) and that is not ordinary in our small theremin world. In fact, it's not uncommon to hear albums by thereminists that master divinely the instrument but are simply not able to produce themselves. This is not the case of Shueh-li Ong, who really “play” the studio like a musical instrument itself.</p>
<p>The album is comprised of ten tracks and the theremin is present in five of them. But theremin purists must beware... Shueh-li's Moog Etherwave Pro is heavily effected so don't expect to hear the canonical theremin sound, if there is one.</p>
<p>The tenth track (unlisted on the packaging) is a live recording of “Recalcitrance”, from the <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/xenovibes1/from/thereminvox" target="_blank">Shueh-li's Xenovibes</a> album and gives an idea of the “Xenovibes the Show” approach, which do not try to reproduce what is on the CD, allowing, instead, guest musicians to bring their own musical contributions rather than playing a setlist.</p>
<p>Drummer John Anthony Martinez appears on all tracks but one, playing acoustic drums and Yamaha DTXPress III electronic drum adding even more vitality and energy to Shueh-li's crackling arrangements.</p>
<p>To sum up, <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/xenovibes2/from/thereminvox" target="_blank">Music From Another Land</a> is a beautiful album well worth listening to in its entirety even if Electronica is not your favourite genre, and Shueh-li Ong is an inspired artist with a solid background who has brought fresh ideas in the theremin field, so I would expect further surprises as she develops her unique artistic path.<br />

<p><b>What's the meaning of your name?</b></p>
<p>XENOVIBES means foreign expressions. It is not a stage name, rather it was a noun I coined to try and explain what I do. It is also a concept that brings people together to play my music in a show that amalgamates the geographical and musical origins of the musicians.</p>
<p><b>That is interesting but I actually meant your real name. What does it mean Shueh-li?</b></p>
<p>Shueh-li is the anglicized version (phonetically though not using the Pin-Yin standard) of my Mandarin Chinese name which means "Snow jasmine". My surname "Ong" means "King". It is my English name as opposed to my Chinese (in characters).</p>
<p><b>Where are you now?</b></p>
<p>I am in the USA with “Xenovibes the Show”.</p>
<p><b>You've said that Music From Another Land "celebrates the beauty of diverse musical cultures and the spirit of live performance." I will ask you to elaborate on the first statement later, but now I'd like to discuss the second. </b></p>
<p>Your CD sounds fresh and alive but it's pretty evident that its production relied heavily on studio work and the use of sequencers. So what you really mean when you say that it "celebrates the spirit of the live performance?"</p>
<p>As a composer, arranger, performer, I work from the “production” angle i.e. how I want the end result to be. The fact that I can pluck ideas from my head and execute them because I have the tools and skills makes me feel very fortunate, for this means I can realize my objectives no matter how simple or complex a project or idea.</p>
<p>With that said, my CDs are me flying solo along with my production style, quite unlike the concerts. Designing from a macro perspective means that my CDs utilize my tools of trade i.e my background in music technology, studio engineering, live performance. It is also a platform to show off my work as a multi-instrumentalist, specifically synthesizer programming/performance and as a thereminist.</p>
<p>Sound recordings give us the liberty to conjure what we can’t quite do “live”, so why not use it to make-believe I say (chuckle). Sequencers are our 20thC version of the multi track recorder, and this one-man-show has utilized it to enable her to fulfill her “objectives”. So you are right. Besides ‘sequencing and studio work’ I have laid down some “wicked” solos using some “wicked” sounds that I hope listeners will appreciate especially when they are being expressed by a synthesizer. I also wanted to promote my spirit of virtuosic playing in this day where most songs made-in-the-studio are as you call “heavily produced”. Neither are right, just different methods. Incidentally, John’s drumming was recorded in a live take.<br />

<p><b>I'd like to know about your studio equipment (hw and sw) and your method of work.</b><br />
I keep a lean studio. Since I play the synthesizer, tin-whistle, guqin (Li MingZhong), theremin (Moog Epro and Etherwave) and sing, I pull together what I need as and when I need them.</p>
<p>While in the USA, I have relied on my power horses; G4 Powerbook, K2661, AKG C3000 and Yamaha O1X brought over from Singapore, OB12 bought in the UK and Alesis monitors purchased in America. The K2661 is an intuitive synth and provides me with many levels of programming options. Together with its 4 independent effects engines and live performance flexibility, I really don’t need much more. Vision DSP and Cubase SX have been my sequencers of choice for digital tracking. I use effects pedals and units with my Theremin and Guqin.</p>
<p>I work from inspiration and with what I have rather then acquire a synthesizer because of its sound library. This is much more challenging and interesting. A broad exposure and understanding of how things work is a must in my method. After that it could begin with a project requirement, a lyric, an instrument, an idea.</p>
<p>You will notice that “Shueh-li’s Xenovibes” the CD has its own theme and emphasis; the more ethnic-electronica style I felt obligated to reproduce in “Music From Another Land” for it became what the mainstream public came to expect.</p>
<p><b>What kind fx you used for the theremin in “Music for another Land”?</b></p>
<p>The Theremin is basically modulated with distortion, flanging and heavy delay on the album. I start with the basics and build the effects to serve 2 purposes; the CD and for concert performance.<br />

<p><b>Tell me about the Guqin.</b></p>
<p>The Guqin has a 3000 year-old history. It is a 7-stringed zither, like a Koto but with no bridge nor frets. The soundhole is almost absent being so tiny. More than 100 harmonics can be played on the guqin. In 2004 it was designated by UNESCO as a masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.</p>
<p>I have carefully selected my instruments to represent my musical training, which is by no means complete. It will take me many MANY more years to learn to play them well (I am also a singer and synthesizer performer). As they say, education is a life-long experience!</p>
<p><b>As for the diverse musical cultures, yes the mash up emerge clearly from the Electronica context. But what does that mean? Does it have to do with your personal history and/or artistic forming? Is it something only related to your last work or is it an integral part of your musical style? And what are your main musical influences?</b></p>
<p>All of the above Valerio. I was after all born in Australia (southern hemisphere) lived and worked in Singapore (1.5deg Nth of the equator) had western classical, music technology and ethnomusicology training besides playing a slew of instruments from these diverse and pop backgrounds.</p>
<p>Each Xenovibes CD has its own theme and objective and “Music From Another Land” the latest is no exception. Depending what I do, I have been labeled classical, esoteric, pop, electronica, artsy. Having worked in theatre and large format esoteric shows, Xenovibes was a deliberate effort to present these ideas to the general public in a form whereby they could enjoy my musical persuasions and performance instruments. My influences? I get excited and intrigued by clever arrangements and sounds, lyrics and production and of course major iconic styles in the history of music both esoteric and pop.</p>
<p>In “Music From Another Land” John lent his background in funk, jazz and latin rhythms to my inclinations. I am of the opinion that there has been no clear demarcation between west and east, north and south for a long time now. We are all east meets west etc etc. Call it fusion if you like.<br />

<p><b>The former question bring us to talk about your musical, and more generally artistical training, since from your notes I see that you're not only a musician. Please, tell me about it.</b></p>
<p>I was trained at the Elder Conservatory as a concert pianist. At the same time I studied electronic music and worked as a producer of the fine music segment at the local radio station. Nagras, cartridges and reel to reel were de rigueur. I went on to research and experiment in the area of Extended Interactive Multimedia Performance where I taught myself 2D and 3D animation. I developed my own style and eventually made my living as a multi-media artist/composer and ran a midi studio with my Electric Muse business partner. These skills saw me in good stead when IT made a big splash in Singapore, where I moved to head the marketing and software development (retail CDs) departments of a multimedia company. To this day I am still involved in creative writing, digital design and layout; my portfolio lists writer/reviewer, playwright, website and corporate image developer and concert producer as my many guises.</p>
<p><b>I'd like to know more on your activity as an instrument builder.</b></p>
<p>In Electric Muse (I am Director of this performance art company etsb.1998 in Singapore), we specialize in creating shows that demonstrate a confluence of new technology with old and man-made instruments. We have made for our own use midi systems, applications using <a href="http://www.csounds.com/" target="_blank">CSOUND</a> that work in tandem with trigger systems and simple instruments made out of new and found material. We might extend the purpose of a basic instrument to play a new role, a method I use in live performance regularly known as extended synthesizer performance techniques.</p>
<p>I consider putting a show together the making of an instrument. This is especially true when I sound design a black box to accommodate a performance system to work the magic in my composition. As a composer, I endeavor to always write music (melodies and songs) along with movements that evoke emotional and physical responses. In the latter, special attention is made to placement of speakers such as having sub-woofers under bleaches to send that all-important subliminal sensation; you can’t quite hear it but you can feel it!</p>
<p><b>Your CD is very well produced (sounds good) and, in fact, I read that you're a producer. Have you ever produced other artists or planning to do so?</b></p>
<p>Producing other artists’ CDs is in the pipeline. I am working with John as <a href="http://www.fingerfootmusic.com/" target="_blank">Fingerfoot Music Productions</a> in this area while in the USA. Our Music Academie in Keller Texas is also a place where we hope to locate and develop talent.<br />

<p><b>Tell me about your collaboration with John Anthony Martinez.</b></p>
<p>This is an interesting question. I am used to working on the percussion material as a composer/producer. Percussion is any “sound” that can be considered a rhythmic element including your standard kit.</p>
<p>John has made his bread and butter out of playing “popular” music. He is a sought after studio drummer and is in the habit of asking what the client requests before suggesting a style which he colours with his own approach. He is able perform a top quality rendition of the expected turns and phrases and more than satisfies the client.</p>
<p>In “Music From Another Land” each piece of music had a percussion track to suggest my intentions; some specific in terms of sounds and kits, along with percussion details that I specifically crafted to evoke the Shueh-li signature feel. I consider my percussion work a separate style from a drummer on the job if you know what I mean.</p>
<p>Utilising the “Xenovibes the Show” approach (*see footnote), I suggested to John the affect I wanted with encouragement to just “play”. In “Robolution” I took inspiration from his drumming in the second half of the piece and the track on the CD took a new turn from the way it has been performed in concert.</p>
<p>John’s rich latin music background makes an appearance in the rendition of the Plena in the title track of “Music From Another Land”. Once it is all recorded and I take it to the production level, I simply followed my ears.</p>
<p><b>How you discovered the theremin and why you decided to play it? Also, did you got lessons or have you learned it yourself? And do you follow a specific playing technique?</b></p>
<p>I discovered the theremin during my electronic music studies. My curiosity for my education made me look for the tools that would “complete” me musically. I came to “know” the theremin; I had a PAIA kit, before I chose to play it “properly” and eventually adopted it into my family of instruments which i study seriously. I created my own method to fit my compositional and performance needs after considering the styles of such influential thereminists as Rockmore. I approach the performance nuances as a synthesizer player &amp; vocalist; where the life of the sound is not only in its phrasing. Putting the theremin through effects squashes the dynamic range of the instrument and changes the response depending on the chosen effect, so one needs to create a performance response vocabulary outside the un-effected sound. I also perform with general monitoring rather than with a theremin dedicated speaker behind my head, and in a pop concert scenario the guitarist’s amp usually drowns me out to a point where I can’t hear myself : - ) In these concerts I play the theremin with effects and as is. I also chose to play it un midi-ed. As part of my show design I already utilize extended synthesizer techniques which are midi functions.</p>
<p><b>What are your plans for the future?</b></p>
<p>I hope to find opportunities to perform around the world and share "Xenovibes the show where ancient art meets new world technology", and to meet fellow thereminist so that I may learn from them. I welcome enquiries from concert programmers and anyone needing original music for film/TV/theatre.</p>
