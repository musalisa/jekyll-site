<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>The RCA Theremin is an electrical musical instrument played by the free movement of the hands in space. The actual production of sound is accomplished by means of a loudspeaker which must be connected to the RCA Theremin. The loudspeaker may be located close to the Theremin or at any convenient distance as required.</p>
<p>The electrical circuits incorporated in the instrument are designed to operate from the house lighting circuit controlled by a power switch mounted on the cabinet. Provision is also made for adjusting pitch and volume by suitable panel controls. A "play-off" switch provides for turning "On or Off" the Theremin with switching off the power supply.</p>

<h3 align="center">INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>The RCA Theremin is a musical instrument operating entirely on electrical principle, and played by the movement of the hands in space. Having no limitations such as key boards, stops, etc., exceptional individuality of expression may be obtained. The instrument covers approximately three and one half octaves, the highest note be­ing about 1400 cycles. Figure 1 illustrates a rear interior cabinet view and Figures 2 and 3 a top and bottom chassis view of the main assembly. The operation of this instrument is covered in the instruction book accompanying each RCA Theremin.</p>
<p>The principle of operation of the RCA Theremin is that of the beat frequency oscillator. The frequency of one oscillator may be varied by the capacity change caused in an associated circuit by the movement of the hand to or from a pitch control rod. Also an additional oscillator provides radio frequency current for heating the filament of a UX-120 arranged so as to control the volume of output, this control being due to the movement of the hand in relation to the volume control loop A detailed descrip­tion of the functioning of the various circuits follows:</p>
<p><a name="electrical"></a></p>
<h3 align="center">ELECTRICAL DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUITS</h3>
<p>As stated in the foregoing, the musical note of the RCA Theremin is produced by two oscillators of slightly different frequency beating together. This beat note is then amplified by two audio stages. The change of note caused by the movement of the hand is due to the change of capacity across what is known as the pitch coil, this slight change having sufficient effect on an adjacent oscillator circuit to change the frequency and thus the beat note, the amount of change depending on the position of the hand in relation to the pitch control rod.<br />
<!--nextpage--><br />
Referring to the schematic circuit Figure 4 and 5 and starting from the pitch control rod we find the circuits functioning as follow:<br />
The pitch control rod is connected to a coil having a very high inductance. Connected to this coil is a small condenser and a small concentrated coil. This entire circuit is tuned by the distributed capacity of its coils and resonates at approximately 172 K.C. Not having any fixed capacitor connected across it for tuning, the ratio of inductance to capacitance is very high. Thus the small increase of capacity caused by the hand close to the pitch rod will cause the circuit to change its natural period considerably, a great deal more than if a large capacity and small inductance were used.<br />
This pitch control circuit is connected to the grid side of the variable pitch control oscillator the frequency of which is slightly greater than that of the pitch control circuit. Bringing the hand close to the pitch rod will increase the parallel capacity in that circuit and thus reduce its frequency. As this capacity is reflected in the oscillator circuit a similar decrease in frequency will result in that circuit, the amount of decrease depending on the closeness of the frequency of the two circuits. Thus a greater decrease in frequency of the oscillator circuit is obtained when the pitch control circuit is close to the oscillator circuit in frequency than when it is at a greater frequency difference.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1400" align="aligncenter" width="468"]<a href="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/03-Figure-2-Top-chassis-view-of-the-main-assembly.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1400" src="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/03-Figure-2-Top-chassis-view-of-the-main-assembly.jpg" alt="Figure 2 - Top chassis view of the main assembly." width="468" height="298" /></a> Figure 2 - Top chassis view of the main assembly.[/caption]</p>
<p>The next circuit to examine is the fixed pitch oscillator. This circuit oscillates at a frequency, when correctly adjusted, at a maximum of 1400 cycles greater than the variable pitch oscillator. The amount of this difference is dependent on the frequency of the variable pitch oscillator the frequency of which is determined by the position of the hand in relation to the pitch control rod. The frequency of the fixed pitch oscillator does not change' while playing.<br />
An example of the functioning of these three circuits follows:<br />
The hand approaches the pitch control rod and increases the capacity across the pitch control circuit. This capacity is reflected across the variable pitch control oscillator and thus reduces its frequency. This causes an audible frequency difference between this oscillator and the fixed pitch oscillator, the frequency of this note depending on the position of the hand. Bringing the hand close to the rod will increase the capacity in the pitch control circuit, reduce the frequency of the variable pitch oscillator and increase the difference between the frequency of this oscillator and the fixed pitch oscillator. Thus an audible note is obtained, the note increasing in frequency as the hand approaches the pitch control rod.<br />
Examining the circuit diagram we find that each oscillator grid is connected to the control and screen grid respectively of a Radiotron UY-224. As the screen grid has the largest area, a 10,000-ohm resistance is connected in series with it to balance the input to this tube and have each oscillator have the same effect on the detector action. This tube is a detector or combining tube that functions much in the same manner as the first detector in a super-heterodyne circuit.<br />
<!--nextpage--></p>
<p>The output of the detector is then amplified by a two-staga audio frequency amplifier, the output of which goes to the loudspeaker. The remaining two tubes, Radiotron UX-120 and UX-17IA together with the first audio frequency amplifier constitute the volume control system. Examining the UXI71A we find that it is in an oscillating circuit that oscillates at about 420 K.C. Connected to the grid side of the oscillator is the volume control loop circuit. This circuit resonates at a frequency below ths oscillator frequency when the hand is entirely removed from the volume control loop. This is done for two reasons. If the two circuits were in exact resonance the load on the oscillator would be too great and operation would be unstable. Also the pick-up current would be high and might damage the tube. The ratio of inductance to capacity in this circuit is also quite high. A small pick-up coil is wound around the inductance coil of the volume control loop circuit and when both circuits are nearly in resonance (hand entirely removed) sufficient radio frequency current flows in this pickup coil to light the filament of the Radiotron UX-120 to which it ie connected. If the plate supply circuit to the Radiotron UY-227, that is the first audio frequency amplifier, is examined we see that the current for this tube is fed through the UX-120. Thus if the UX-120 were at maximum brilliancy, maximum volume would be obtained. Likewise, if it were not lighted no signal output would be obtained due to no plate current flowing.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1401" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/04-Figure-3-Sub-chassis-view-of-the-main-assembly.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1401" src="http://www.prezioso.it/tvox/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/04-Figure-3-Sub-chassis-view-of-the-main-assembly.jpg" alt="Figure 3 - Sub-chassis view of the main assembly." width="600" height="394" /></a> Figure 3 - Sub-chassis view of the main assembly.[/caption]</p>
<p>A condenser and resistor are placed in the plate voltage supply to the first audio tube which regulates the time constant of the volume control. They are adjusted to prevent any undue lag in operation of the volume control, while preventing quick accidental variations in volume due to a slight unsteadiness of the hand. The condenser also increases the efficiency of the audio amplifier by preventing a loss of A.C. voitage across the Radiotron UX-120. The low side of the resistance instead of being connected to ground is connected to a tap on the grid leak of the volume control oscillator. This supplies a small negative potential to the plate of the first audio tube and insures that zero volume is secured when the UX-120 emission is zero or nearly so.<br />
Now getting back to the oscillator circuit that lights the filament of the UX-120 we see that if the load current is reduced, the brilliancy of the UX-120 will be decreased and likewise the volume. Thus when the hand approaches the volume control loop, the natural period of the circuit is decreased in frequency, the circuit is out of resonance with the oscillator by an amount depending on the position of the hand and less current is flowing in the pick-up coil with a consequent reduction in volume.<br />
Thus we see from the foregoing explanation, a movement of one hand in relation to the pitch control rod will cause a variation in pitch and thus allow the playing of music. A movement of the other hand in relation to the volume control loop will cause an increase or decrease in volume. The combination of these two movements constitutes the technique of playing the RCA Theremin.<br />

A 0-5 milliammeter " placed in series with the plate of either tubs through the connections provided in the adapter. The volume adjustment on the front of the Theremin is then set at maximum. The right rear door is now opened, the safety switch held down with one hand and the volume control oscillator trimming condenser adjusted until the milliammeter indicates 2 M.A. is flowing with door closed. The pitch should be around zero beat when making this adjustment. This is the cosrect adjustment provided the effect noted in (c) is not obtained, in which case the capacity should be reduced until another reading of 2 M.A. is obtained. Thus the correct adjustment is fonud when the milliammeter reads 2 with the least capacity at which such a reading may be obtained.</td>

These are the left and center trimming condensers respectively at the rear of the Theremin. Care should he taken not to adjust the oscillators so that the note will be higher than 1400 cycles, as unstab1e operation may resu1t. 1100 cycles is about C sharp, two octaves above middle C, and 1400 cycles about F sharp, two octaves above middle C on a piano. A tuning fork or piano - if available - can be used for a pitch standard. A reversal of connections to the concentrated coil located inside of the large tone coil will also reduce the range of the Theremin.</td>

Also this condition may be caused by the two pitch oscillators being too close to the frequency of the tone coil. This is caused by too much capacity at each of the tvo pitch oscillator trimming condensers. An open tone coil will cause a constant high frequency note with little variation caused by various positions of the hand in relation to the pitch control rod.</td>

An erratic UY-227 in the oscillator socket will probably function normally as an audio amplifier. Too much capacity at each of the trimming condensers on the pitch oscillators may cause a skip effect in the range in addition to a greater than normal range. The effect noted in (7) may also be noted.</td>

<p>The following voltages taken at each Radiotron socket with the Theremin in operating condition should prove of value when checking with test sets such as the Weston Model 537, Type 2, or others giving similar readings. The plate currents shown are not necessarily accurate for each tube, as the cable in the test set will cause some circuits to oscillate, due to its added capacity. Small variations of voltages will be caused by different tubes and line voltages. Therefore the following values must be taken as approximately those that will be found under varying conditions.

<p>* The range of variation of the readings taken on Radiotrons Nos 4, 5, 6 and 7 is caused by a change in the resonance point of the volume control loop circuit. Any object (such as the measuring instrument cable, body of the operator etc.) coming in proximity to this circuit will give the variations noted above.<br />

<h3 align="left">(12) METHODS FOR CONTINUITY TESTS</h3>
<p>In making a continuity test whether it be for the Theremin assembly or the S. P. U., the following procedure is recommended:<br />
Disconnect the cable connecting the socket power unit to the Theremin assembly, the loudspeaker, and the A.C. supply cord at its outlet.<br />
A pair of headphones, with at least 41/2 volts in series, or preferably a voltmeter with sufficient voltage to give a full scale deflection when connected across the battery terminals, should be used in making these tests, for example, a 0-50 volt meter with a 4,5volt "B" battery. The Radiotron socket contacts, numbers and lugs used in these tests are shown in Figure 6. The Theremin continuity wiring diagram is illustrated in Figure 8, the S. P. U. terminal numbers are shown in Figure 7.<br />
Test leads should be of the flexible insulated type with partially insulated testing tips, so that false readings will not be obtained through contact with the hands. Similarly the hand should not touch the chassis or component parts.<br />
The contacts of the test equipment should be placed across the terminals or leads indicated in the following test table under the column marked "Terminals." If the results are negative the cause of such negative effect will be found in the last column under the heading, "Incorrect Effect Caused By." The second column indicates the approximate correct resistance in ohms of most of the circuits tested.</p>

<h2 align="center">PART II-MAKING REPLACEMENTS</h2>
<p>The various assemblies of the RCA Theremin are readily accessible and replacements are easily made. However, there are some operations that require careful procedure as noted in the following paragraphs.</p>
<h3 align="left">(1) REPLACING PARTS IN THE THEREMIN ASSEMBLY</h3>
<p>All parts in the Theremin assembly are readily replaceable with tools ordinarily used in servicing radio receiving sets. However the fixed condensers used across the variable and pitch oscillator coils are somewhat more critical in values than other parts and may require some experimental work before a satisfactory replacement is made. These condensers are roughly adjusted to the pitch coil and after a replacement is made, the Theremin should be adjusted for corect operation by means of the trimming condensers. If this is not possible then a substitution for the condenser just replaced should be tried and one found that will allow a correct adjustment to be made by the trimming condensers. A condenser that does not function satisfactorily in one Theremin instrument may prove O.K. in another.</p>

<p>When replacing a pitch control coil, sometimes a similar condition will result. If after replacing a pitch coil it is found that the maximum range is not obtained by adjustment of the trimming condensers one of the following procedures must be used.</p>
<p>(a) Try several pitch coils. One may be found of the correct inductance for use in place of the defective one.</p>
<p>(b) If the range is low, that is less than 1100 cycles, try removing a few turns from the coil and readjusting the trimming condensers.</p>
<p>(c) Replace both the fixed condensers across the fixed and variable pitch oscillators with ones of a greater capacity. Replacing one without the other will not remedy the situation. Both must be replaced simultaneously.</p>

<h3 align="left">(2) REMOVAL OF PARTS AND LOCATION OF CABLE</h3>
<p>The cable that is used to connect the Theremin chassis and the S. P. U. is clamped securely in a definite place on the inside of the cabinet. Whenever any assembly is removed, and this cable is shifted from its position, it is very important that it be returned to its original position when the Theremin is returned to normal operation. Failure to have this cable in its normal position may result in inability to adjust the Theremin for normal operation.<br />

<h2 align="left">Success in Radio Service Work</h2>
<p>The most valuable asset of any business is GOOD WILL. And Good Will is nothing more or less than public confidence in you and your business; confidence to the point that your customers are willing and glad to recommend you and your services to acquaintances and friends.<br />
That kind of Good Will does more to build business than all other forces combined. Three factors are involved in building Good Will for a radio service business in gaining the confidence of your customers to the point that they will do a selling job for you. These three essentials of success are:</p>

<p><b><i>Technical Ability</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Business Methods</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Parts and Test Instruments</i></b></p>
<p><b>Technical Ability.</b> Your technical ability is refIected in the test instruments you employ, by the appearance of your shop and work bench, and by the "kit" that you Carry into customers' homes. Like the succesful members of any of the professions, the radio service engineer must continually study to keep up with the times.</p>
<p><b>Business Methods.</b> Insofar as your customers are concerned there are just two indices to your business methods: The way you handle yourself on the job and the quality of the parts and the Test Instruments you use.</p>
<p>Contrast the picture of the two Service Men shown on this page. Each, is about to make a call. Each is a a good service men, so far as ability goes. But there the likeness ends. One has business written all over him. One has built his success on the foundation of fair prices for good work and highest quality parts. The other wonders why his business is slow even though he offers "cut prices " as a result of the bargain replacement parts he uses.</p>
