<p>Music And Magic have always been inseparable from one another.</p>
<p>But the magic of the Theremin is unlike any other instrument. Just to play the theremin, one needs an affinity to magic. All other instruments, including the most exotic, are played by touching them, by blowing, bowing, hitting, plucking, scratching or pressing. The Theremin is the only instrument from which sound is enticed without even touching it.</p>
<p>The Berlin-based musician, Barbara Buchholz, first made her name as a jazz musician playing bass, before discovering the Theremin and studying at the Theremin Center in Moscow.</p>
<p>A student of the master classes of Lydia Kavina - a great-niece of the Theremin’s originator Lev Thermen – Barbara Buchholz has retrieved the instrument from oblivion and is finding new uses and applications for it in contemporary music.</p>
