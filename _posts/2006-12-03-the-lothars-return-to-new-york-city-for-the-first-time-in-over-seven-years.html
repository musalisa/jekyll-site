<p>"Dziga Vertov's masterpiece is an application of 'life as it is lived.' A cameraman travels around a city with a camera slung over his shoulder, documenting urban life with dazzling inventiveness. This playful film is at once a documentary of a day in the life of the Soviet Union, a documentary of the filming of said documentary, and a depiction of an audience watching the film. Even the editing of the film is documented. It makes the cameraman the hero, and is one of the most dynamic experiments with montage; the film also uses trick photography, animation, slow motion and speeded-up shots."</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wobblymusic.com/lothars/" target="_blank">The Lothars</a> are a theremin-based improvisational ensemble which includes hammered dulcimer, log drum, electro-flute, prerecorded samples, and at least two theremins (a word not often seen in its plural form). What better soundtrack for a 1929 Soviet silent film than a band featuring an instrument invented 10 years earlier by a Soviet scientist? It's a match made in Heaven! Or a Socialist Utopia, as the case may be....</p>
<p>The Lothars last performed their soundtrack to this film in June, 2003, at the Coolidge Corner Theater in Brookline, MA. Don't wait another 3 1/2 years for your next chance to experience this melange of sight and sound!</p>
<p>The Galapagos Art Space is at 70 N 6th Street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Tickets are $8. Visit <a href="http://www.galapagosartspace.com/" target="_blank">www.galapagosartspace.com</a> for directions and other details.</p>
