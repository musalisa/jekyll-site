<p>Dear Professor Theremin,</p>
<p>On my return from the West in October I tried to get in touch with you. I wanted very much to see you again and to learn of the progress of your work. I was sorry - on my account - that you had left New York. I hope that you have been able to go on with your experiments in sound and that new discoveries have rewarded your efforts.</p>
<p>I have just begun a work in which an important part is given to a large chorus and with it I want to use several of your instruments - augmenting their range as in those I used for my Equatorial - especially in the high range. Would you be so kind as to let me know if it is possible to procure these and where ... and in case of modifications in what they consist. Also if you have conceived or constructed new ones would you let me have a detailed description of their character and use. I don't want to write any more for the old Man-power instruments and am handicapped by the lack of adequate electrical instruments for which I now conceive my music.</p>
<p>Mr. Fediushine has kindly offered to forward this letter to you.</p>
<p>Please let me hear from you as soon as possible.</p>
<p>With cordial greetings and best wishes in which my wife joins me,</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Edgard Varese</p>
<p>P.S. If any of your assistants or collaborators are continuing your work in New York would you kindly put me in touch with them.</p>
