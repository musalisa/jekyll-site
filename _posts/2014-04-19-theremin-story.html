<p>The inventor of the first electronic musical instrument was a Russian scientist, Lev Sergeyevitch Termen. Originally he wanted to construct an electronic burglar-alarm (which he named EtherPhone), by using the then newly invented vacuum-tubes. While experimenting with the device he took notice of a strange effect: when his hands got near to some parts of the equipment the pitch of the alarm-sound changed. This gave the idea of a revolutionary new type of musical instrument to the scientist. He put the equipment into a wooden box and attached two antennas to it. A vertical one, with which he could control the pitch of the sound, and a horizontal one, which he used to control the volume of the sound. He named this new musical instrument theremin. The theremin player doesn't have to touch the instrument, while playing it. He or she, like a music conductor just have to move his or her hands parallel to the antennas - the music is created by movement alone. It did not take long to the inventor - who was a trained cellist as well, as a physicist and an astronomer, - to learn to play the works of classic composers on the theremin</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-1017"></a>Professor Termen first introduced his invention in the autumn of 1921, at the Russian Academy of Sciences, to the participants of the Eighth All-Russian Engineering Congress. Lenin attended the event, as he was promoting his Electricity to Russia program. He was among the audience during Professor Termen's presentation of the theremin and took keen interest in the device. The inventor was trying to emphasize theremin's usefulness, as a burglar alarm, but more interested in playing it, as a musical instrument. Without any assistance from Professor Termen he played Glinka's Skylark on the theremin, to great delight of the audience and the press.</p>
<p>Some sources say, that shortly after meeting with Lenin, to the recommendation of the leader of the Revolution started Professor Termen's collaboration with the Russian Secret Services, which lasted for many years. He was commissioned to work on secret experiments, in the fields of telecommunications. As early as in 1923 he developed a low-resolution television equipment, which was immediately declared a state secret by the Russian Government, therefore Professor Termen hasn't been credited as one of the pioneers of television.</p>
<p>The theremin was an instant public success in Russia. Those, who had heard it were talking about the instrument's hypnotic sound, which they compared to the sound of a girls choir and as of an enchanted cello. The scientist changed his name to Leon Theremin and soon started to give concerts with his instrument, in St. Petersburg and in Moscow. He played the works of Ravel, Rachmaninoff and Thsaikovsky to applauding audiences everywhere. 'A Symphonic Mistery', the first music, explicitly composed for theremin was the work of A. F. Paschenko. Performed by Professor Theremin and the St. Petersburg Symphonic Orchestra, the work debuted in May, 1924, in Leningrad.</p>
<p>Supported with money and valuable connections by the Russian Intelligence Services Professor Theremin took on an international concert tour in the same year. He played in Berlin, Rome, Milan, London and Paris, with great success. Robert Moog, who later became the inventor the synthesizer, was among the audience during Professor Theremin's concert in Paris. "They have to call in the police, because the Parisian Opera was under siege by crowds of people, who came to hear the theremin. First time in the history of the Parisian Opera they have to sell standing room only tickets to the boxes on the balcony", he writes. At the end of 1927 Professor Theremin took an ocean liner to America. By some accounts the luxury liner's captain was an avid fan of the theremin, who charmed the inventor into giving a surprise concert to the passengers, in the ballroom of the ship, during the voyage.</p>
<p>Theremin arrived to New York at the end of 1927. He instantly became the favorite of the American elite. His first, private, by invitation only concert was attended by such celebrities as Sergey Rachmaninov, Arturo Toscanini, Nijinsky and most of the top film producers and directors of Hollywood. After the introductory solo concert Professor Theremin constructed a series of theremins and had professional musicians practice on it.</p>
<p>Professor Theremin and his ensemble of four theremin players gave their first, public concert with the New York Royal Philharmonic Orchestra on the 27th of August, 1928, Carnegie Hall, New York. "I couldn't believe my ears. When I have first heard about the theremin I thought that its sound would be rather sharp, unpleasant. Yet I heard the music of Heaven tonight. When the five theremin created a chord, it sounded more powerful than if all the words symphony orchestras would sound at the same time", writes a member of the audience. More and more celebrities became fans of the theremin, such as Albert Einstein, Charlie Chaplin, Leopold Stockowski an Dwight Eisenhower, who later became the president of the United States. After the premier performance of Joseph Schillinger's First Air Telephone Suite Professor Theremin and his instrument became world famous. The RCA Victor Co. put the first, simplified theremins on the market in the same year, calling the product ThereminVox. Some of these were combined with a built in gramophone, to provide orchestral accompaniment and recorded instructions to the players, on gramophone disks, also supplied by RCA. The theremin did not become a popular instrument, due to the fact that it is impossible to teach theremin-playing. It is an art, which one must born with. They built about 3000 theremins, but sold only 200 of the series, before the company stopped manufacturing and distribution of the product. Those few first surviving RCA theremins in collections today worth a fortune to their owners.</p>
<p>The fact that the theremin did not sell well commercially had no influence on Professor Theremin's carrier. He gave one concert after the other, all of which were highly successful. He met a Russian born violinist, Clara Rockmore (then called Reisenberg), who soon became the greatest theremin virtuoso of all times. She was born in Vilnius, Lithuania, and already was giving concerts at age 5. Just as Theremin, Clara also studied at the St. Petersburg Music Conservatory, where she was the youngest student ever accepted. She was among the audience at Professor Theremin's first St. Petersburg concerts and became an instant theremin fan. To help her violinist carrier, Clara moved to New York with his family in the middle of the 1920s. Due to a debilitating disease to her hands, soon she couldn't play the violin anymore. Because she could play the theremin without having to touch it, she could learn it fast. Soon she was touring all across America, playing the theremin on concerts, accompanied by the most famous symphonic orchestras of her time. Rachmaninov's Vocalize and his Song of Gruzia; Saint Saens's The Swan; De Falla's Pantomime; Acron's Hebrew Melodies; Wieniawski's Romance; Stravinsky's Berceuse; Ravel's Habanera; Tschaykovsky's Sentimental Waltz and Melancholic Serenade and Glazunov's Chant Du Mentrel were the most often played works on her repertoire. Clara and Professor fell in love with each other, but they could not marry against Clara's family's orthodox beliefs.</p>
<p>Theremin opened his own music and dance studio in New York, where he regularly presented his latest inventions. First he constructed an electronic dance-stage with a steel plated floor, which sensed the movements of the dancers and shaped the sound accordingly. He called his electronic dance-stage TerpsiTone. Commissioned by the composer Henry Cowell he has built a device - Rhytmicon, - which is the ancestor of today's sequencers ad drum machines. He also built an electronic cello a micro tonal electric harmonium and a theremin, which can be controlled by the movements of the eyes alone. He surprised Clara Rockmore on her birthday, by giving her a cake, which started to spin around if anybody went near to it. During this period he met a black dancer, Lavinia Williams, whom he married in New York.</p>
<p>Ever since he arrived to the States he regularly reported to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service. He gave information on the latest American inventions in the fields of science and technology, on American politics, on American public sentiments towards Russia and the prospect of war, and also informed on the personal life the industrialists, politicians, celebrities he was in contact with. In 1937 he was ordered by his superiors at the secret service to return to Russia at once, for he was needed there to work as a scientist on the preparations for war. Professor Theremin refused to obey the order and stayed in New York. In 1938 he was kidnapped from this laboratory by Russian agents and was forcibly taken back to Russia. He was accused and found guilty of anti-soviet propaganda. First he was imprisoned at Butirskaya Prison, in Moscow, then he was sent to a secret Kolima prison camp, in Siberia.</p>
<p>There was a well equipped scientific laboratory in the camp, where jailed engineers and scientists were laboring on Stalin's secret plans. Professor Theremin was assigned to produce electronic bugging devices. He is credited with inventing a device, which could listen in conversations, which are taking place inside of buildings, by sensing the vibrations of the window glasses. With fellow prisoners, such as Andrey Tupolyev, the airplane-designer and S. Korolyov rocket-scientist Professor Theremin developed the plans for a radio-controlled robot spy-plane. Another invention of Professor Theremin was a long distance, powerful listening device, which emitted signals strong enough to pass through several meters thick steel-reinforced concrete walls and metal-plates. He called this device Buran. For developing Buran he was given the Stalin Award, First Class, by the Soviet Government and he won an early release from the prison camp too. After his release he kept on working on further KGB commissioned scientific projects. The KGB arranged a professorial position for him, at the Moscow Music Conservatory's Acoustic Department. There he constricted several new electronic music instruments, among them a polyphonic theremin, on which the players could play chords too, a significant improvement since his first theremin, on which he could play only single-line melodies.</p>
<p>In 1967 Harry Schonberg, a journalist, who was working for the New York Times discovered Professor Theremin working at the Moscow Music Conservatory. He wrote an article about him and his current researches. As a result of the article's publication Professor Theremin was fired from his job, he was forbidden to have any, but KGB-controlled contacts with people. His researches came to a standstill.</p>
<p>His American friends thought him dead in the Gulag, but in 1991 he was found alive, living in Moscow. He was 94 years old in that time. His friends took him to New York with great fanfare. He was seen wondering on the streets of Manhattan, like one of the narcoleptics described in the books of William Burroughs. He met again with Clara Rockmore, who was 88 years old in that time. They gave a concert together at Radio City Music Hall. The name of Professor Theremin was the talk of New York again. He was featured in the papers and on every television stations across the United States and Canada. He died two years later, in 1993. Clara Rockmore survived him by five years.</p>
<p>The theremin-fanatic Robert Moog's creation, the synthesizer's idea was based on the theremin, Professor Theremin's original invention. They are manufacturing digital, MIDI-capable theremins today, as the instrument is becoming fashionable in popular and experimental music again. The sound of the theremin can be heard in many movie's soundtrack, such as Hitchcock's Spellbound; Lost Weekend and The Day When The Earth Stood Still; James Bond movies; Kurosawa's Dodes'kaden. The film of Steven M. Martin, Theremin: An Electronic Odyssey was the first to give detailed information on the story of the theremin and as of its inventor. The various inventions of Professor Theremin inspired many contemporary works of music, such as John Cage's Variations V. for Dancers and Antenna and Leland Smith's Music for Violin and Rhytmicon. In rock music it was Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page, who first used theremin, in the song Whole Lotta Love. He was followed by Brian Wilson, who used the instrument in the Beach Boys song, Good Vibrations. We can find the special sound of the theremin in recordings by Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, the Pixies and a number of other artists and groups.</p>
