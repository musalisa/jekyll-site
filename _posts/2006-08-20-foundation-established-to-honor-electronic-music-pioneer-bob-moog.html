<p>Asheville, NC. August 21, 2006 – Family, friends and colleagues of the late Robert A. Moog, inventor of the modern electronic synthesizer, have created a new foundation to honor his remarkable legacy of scientific innovation and intellectual curiosity.</p>
<p>The Bob Moog Memorial Foundation for Electronic Music -- located in Asheville, N.C., where Moog spent the last 25 years of his life – has four goals, according to Foundation Director Michelle Moog-Koussa and a $5 million fund-raising target.</p>
<p>“Our first step is to create opportunities for future musicians,” said Moog-Koussa, one of Moog’s five grown children. “Education was so important to my father.” The Foundation plans to establish endowed scholarships at University of North Carolina Asheville, where Moog and his wife taught; at the Berklee Colleg of Music, where Moog collaborated with staff and students; and at Cornell University, where he completed his doctoral degree.</p>
<p>The foundation is also planning to create outreach programs that will bring electronic instruments and training to disadvantaged children, to sponsor international music competitions, and to create a Bob Moog Memorial Museum in Asheville.</p>

<p>The foundation will kick off its fund-raising efforts on August 21, 2006, with a new website at <a href="http://www.moogfoundation.org/">www.moogfoundation.org</a>.</p>
<p>Moog, pioneer of the electro-theremin in the United States, died a year ago, leaving an indelible mark on the music industry. His instruments are known world-wide, and have been included in recordings by The Beatles, The Beach Boys, Stevie Wonder, Yes and a host of others.</p>
<p>Several musicians have agreed to serve on the foundation’s advisory board, including Rick Wakeman of Yes, and Keith Emerson of Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer. Representatives of Moog Music will also serve on the advisory board. Executive Board members include all of Moog’s children and his wife, Ileana Grams-Moog.</p>
