<p><b>Claude Debussy</b> (August 22, 1862 - March 25, 1918), composer of impressionistic classical music.</p>
<p>Born in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Yvelines, France, Claude Debussy studied with Guiraud and others at the Paris Conservatoire (1872-84) and as an 1884 Prix de Rome winner, went to Rome, Italy (1885-7), though more important impressions came from his visits to Bayreuth (1888, 1889) and from hearing Javanese music in Paris (1889).</p>
<p>Wagner's influence is evident in the cantata La damoiselle élue (1888) and the Cinq poèmes de Baudelaire (1889) but other songs of the period, notably the settings of Verlaine (Ariettes oubliées, Trois mélodies, Fêtes galantes, set 1) are in a more capricious style, as are parts of the still somewhat Franckian g Minor String Quartet (1893); in that work he used not only the Phrygian mode but also less standard modes, notably the whole-tone mode, to create the floating harmony he discovered through the work of contemporary writers: Mallarmé in the orchestral Prélude à 'L'après-midi d'un faune' (1894) and Maeterlinck in the opera <i>Pelléas et Mélisande</i>, dating in large part from 1893-5 but not completed until 1902. These works also brought forward a fluidity of rhythm and color quite new to Western music.</p>
<p><i>Pelléas</i>, with its rule of understatement and deceptively simple declamation, also brought an entirely new tone to opera - but an unrepeatable one. Debussy worked on other opera projects and left substantial sketches for two pieces after tales by Edgar Allan Poe (<i>Le diable dans le beffroi</i> and <i>La chute de la maison Usher</i>), but neither was completed. Instead, the main works were orchestral pieces, piano sets, and songs.</p>
<p>The orchestral works include the three <i>Nocturnes</i> (1899), characteristic studies of veiled harmony and texture ('Nuages'), exuberant cross-cutting ('Fêtes') and seductive whole-tone drift ('Sirènes'). <i>La mer</i> (1905) essays a more symphonic form, with a finale that works themes from the first movement, though the centerpiece ('Jeux de vagues') proceeds much less directly and with more variety of color. The three <i>Images</i> (1912) are more loosely linked, and the biggest, 'Ibéria', is itself a triptych, a medley of Spanish allusions. Finally, the ballet <i>Jeux</i> (1913) contains some of Debussy's strangest harmony and texture in a form that moves freely over its own field of motivic connection. Other late stage works, including the ballets <i>Khamma</i> (1912) and <i>La boîte à joujoux</i> (1913) and the mystery play <i>Le martyre de St. Sébastien</i> (1911), were not completely orchestrated by Debussy, though <i>St. Sébastien</i> is remarkable in sustaining an antique modal atmosphere that otherwise was touched only in relatively short piano pieces (e.g.'La cathédrale engloutie').</p>
<p>The important piano music begins with works which, Verlaine fashion, look back at rococo decorousness with a modern cynicism and puzzlement (<i>Suite bergamasque</i>, 1890; <i>Pour le piano</i>, 1901). But then, as in the orchestral pieces, Debussy began to associate his music with visual impressions of the East, Spain, landscapes etc, in a sequence of sets of short pieces. His last volume of <i>Etudes</i> (1915) interprets similar varieties of style and texture purely as pianistic exercises and includes pieces that develop irregular form to an extreme as well as others influenced by the young <a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/85/index.html" target="_blank">Stravinsky</a> (a presence too in the suite <i>En blanc et noir for two pianos</i>, 1915). The rarefaction of these works is a feature of the last set of songs, the <i>Trois poèmes de Mallarmé</i> (1913), and of the <i>Sonata for flute, viola and harp</i> (1915), though the sonata and its companions also recapture the inquisitive Verlainian classicism. The planned set of six sonatas was cut short by the composer's death in 1918 from rectal cancer.</p>
<p>Claude Debussy died in Paris on March 25, 1918 and was interred there in the Cimetière de Passy.</p>
