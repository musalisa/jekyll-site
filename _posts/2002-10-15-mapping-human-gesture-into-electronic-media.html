<p>Troika Ranch is the name of a New York-based performers' group founded in 1993 by Dawn Stoppiello, a dancer and a coreographer, and Mark Coniglio, a composer who studied under <a href="http://www.mortonsubotnick.com/" target="_blank">Morton Subotnick</a>. Troika Ranch develop works of what they call slash arts: dance + music + theatre + interactive media. Dawn and Mark decided not to use the term "multidisciplinary" since the most salient feature of slash arts is, in their opinion, the slash itself: the union of various expressive forms in a coherent whole. Troikas' performances resound chaotic rythms of contemporary urban life and are based on a fascinating mixture of music, dance and <a href="http://www.troikaranch.org/technology.html" target="_blank">interactive technologies</a> (developed by Mark Coniglio himself) whose goal is to allow the performer to control the entire theatrical space with her body.</p>
<p>In a joint effort with Morton Subotnick, Mark has developed "<a href="http://www.troikaranch.org/interactor.html" target="_blank">Interactor</a>" a Macintosh software that allows the computer to interpret data coming from a set of sensors placed on the performer's body or somewhere on the stage, so allowing the performer herself to directly control different devices such as synthesizers, theatrical lighting, digital audio effects, video apparatus and even robots. Mark has also built a costume (the "<a href="http://www.troikaranch.org/mididancer.html" target="_blank">MidiDancer</a>") that hides eight sensors placed in crucial points, such as elbows and knees. Through the sensors, the movements of the body are detected by a tiny computer that codifies the signal in such a way that it can be sent to a receiver/decoder plugged to the computer, by means of a radio transmitter.</p>
<p>Between the many performances realized by Troika beginning from 1989, the most demanding were <a href="http://www.troikaranch.org/wrk/edist.html" target="_blank">The Electronic Disturbance</a> (inspired by the book of the same name by the <a href="http://www.critical-art.net/" target="_blank">Critical Art Ensemble</a>), <a href="http://www.troikaranch.org/wrk/verasbody.html" target="_blank">Vera’s Body</a> and the more recent <a href="http://www.troikaranch.org/wrk/cwcr.html" target="_blank">The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz</a>, presented for the first time in New York City and, later, in Lincoln, Nebraska.</p>
<p><b>Saggini:</b> What is the story of Troika ranch?</p>
<p><b>Coniglio:</b> Troika Ranch is a New York City based dance theater group founded by myself, composer Mark Coniglio, and choreographer Dawn Stoppiello in 1993. Our mission is simple: to create new live performances that unite four disciplines: dance / music / theater / interactive technology. Dawn and I first met in 1986 when we were students at <a href="http://www.calarts.edu/" target="_blank">California Institute of the Arts</a>. There, we discovered that we shared an interest in creating performances went beyond the normal confines of dance and music. We continued our collaboration after graduating in 1989. As we continued to collaborate, we decided to create a company dedicated to this work.</p>
<p><b>Saggini:</b> What does "Troika Ranch" means?</p>
<p><b>Coniglio:</b> The name is the result of a long, and humorous, conversation that I had with my friend <a href="http://www.artscilab.org/pages/Woody.html" target="_blank">Woody Vasulka</a> - a pioneering video artist and one of the founders of <a href="http://www.thekitchen.org/" target="_blank">The Kitchen</a> in New York. We were on a residency together, and decided that every entity in the American Southwest was in fact a "ranch" (Woody lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico so he should know). There would be the "Vasulka Video Art Ranch", and the "Dawn and Mark Interactive Performance Ranch" etc. Later, about the time we decided to form the company, I seemed to come across the word "Troika" several times. It was the combination that I liked: a Russian word which (for me) brings up images of Eastern Europe, and the Americanized Spanish word "Ranch, which makes one think of U.S. Southwest. I think it is the opposition of the two words suggests drama: one element of our work that is very important.</p>
<p><b>Saggini:</b> A recurring theme in your works seems to be that of polarities and the movement between them: corporeal bodies trying to appropriate characteristics of electronic bodies and vice-versa (The Electronic Disturbance); the conflict between mind and body (Vera's Body); the transformation of the soul from broken and decrepit to vital and transcendent and, once again, the passage from corporeal to electronic life through the downloading of mind from the brain to a silicon replacement (The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz). What does this mean? And how autobiographical are your works?</p>

<p><b>Coniglio:</b> Well, my own personal experience of life is one of loss. Now that sounds a bit depressing and dramatic, but I see this process as quite beautiful. I think that for each of us there is a significant moment in our lives when we first experienced an emotional injury: finding out that someone you cared deeply about had lied to you, the loss of a loved one, etc. It is at this moment that we lose innocence in exchange for wisdom. Each person handles this in different ways, some deny that the injury happened, others focus on the injury and become bitters, and still others integrate the experience and while attempting to retain the spirit of innocent hopefulness that existed before. These experiences continue through out one’s life, though it is often the case that the first one is the most notable. To me personally this process is poignantly beautiful, even though it is often quite painful.</p>
<p>There is no direct autobiographical representation of my personal life in our work. But, I suppose that all of the pieces Dawn and I have made portray the process described above in one way or another. And, the idea that technology is the motor that drives the transformation represented in many of these narratives represents my own experience with the technological world - at once dehumanising and intoxicating. So I am certainly "in there", just not in a direct way.<br />

<p><b>Saggini:</b> In your hi-tech works, technology is used to enhance human body possibilities. But sometimes one has the feeling that the same technology is some sort of burden for the body, which is forced to measure its strengths against the blind force of technology.</p>
<p><b>Coniglio:</b> We think about this constantly. In the past I have referred to our technology as "parasitic", in the sense that it feeds off of the live performer, and has no cannot survive without this host. But this parasitic relationship goes both directions: do we modify the movement of a dancer who is being monitored to satisfy the needs of the technology that is reacting to her movement? The answer is yes, but, and I feel this is important, <i>not unconsciously</i>. We try to be hyper-aware of the ways in which we are accommodating the technology that we choose to make use of, so that these limitations inform the piece itself. I must point out at this point that there is a similar limitation, however, when I choose to write music for the violin or the tuba. Each has "technological" constraints that I must address if I am going to create music appropriate for the individual instrument.</p>
<p><b>Saggini:</b> Much has been said and written about body's obsolescence and it seems that for some people could be desirable to get rid of the body to overcome its material limitations and demands, think about people like <a href="http://www.stelarc.va.com.au/" target="_blank">Stelarc</a> or <a href="http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm" target="_blank">Hans Moravec</a>. And you, in <i>The Electronic Disturbance</i> and also in <i>The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz</i>, depict the effort of the physical body to transcend its very nature becoming electronic. But the reality we experience in our everyday life - be it good or bad - can't be separated from the body, and we can transcend our body only upon death. Is this attraction towards technology a desire of death?</p>
<p><b>Coniglio:</b> We don't advocate dematerialization. I like the human body and its failings. The "electronic" characters in the <i>Electronic Disturbance</i> are in search of this very thing: a limitation! To be able to change yourself into anything at any moment, to be unburdened by gravity or time, these are things that are possible to the "electronic body". But for them, death might be a gift. So in the course of the piece, they attempt to enter into the physical world, to see what it means to be <i>unable</i> to do something. I cannot say that one state is better than the other, because I have not been in both. But I can say that we tend to seek that which we do not have, and it is the seeking of this (perhaps) unattainable goal that creates crisis. Crisis the basis of drama, in my way of thinking. So this is why we have both the "corporeal body" and "electronic body" represented in the <i>Electronic Disturbance</i>, because it is the opposition of these two states that provides the possiblity for a drama.</p>
<p><b>Saggini:</b> Italian futurists celebrated the man becoming machine, but to them the machine was the metaphor of a spiritual condition, a path towards transcendence. Do you think that the relationship with technology could become a "mystic experience" or your approach is totally rational?</p>
<p><b>Coniglio:</b> Well, if by "totally rational" you mean do we believe that technology will provide some form of utopia, then I would say no. On the other hand, we do not feel that it will in some way destroy us either. These kinds of polarities make for dramatic thinking, but, in actuality, things tend to happen somewhere in the middle. What we do believe, and of this we are certain, the presence of ever expanding technology in our lives will change us, it will color the way that we treat one and other, and how we live our lives from day to day. It does so now, and will continue to do so in the future. Few can really see where this influence will take us, but it will surely mean that our children’s children will be people that we can hardly imagine. It is this future that interests us, and that we are curious to examine.</p>
<p>Though I want to step back to say that the idea of technology as religion is one that we considered a great deal when we were making the <i>Electronic Disturbance</i>. Is cyberspace a spiritual world? I would say that for some (hackers certainly, but for many others too) it is. But I cannot say that my personal relationship with technology is mystical, except in the sense that, because it is so much a part of my way of being, it is an extension of me. But any artist who has developed an intimate relationship with their chosen discipline would say the same, so I do not find this unusual.</p>

<p><b>Saggini:</b> Since you not only use technology, but you also create it, can you tell us what come first: art needs technology to express itself or technology needs some art to make its own celebration?</p>
<p><b>Coniglio:</b> Dawn and I work in various ways depending on the technology that is being used. The most demanding collaboration is when we use the MidiDancer system, because we must be together to create the piece. Since her body causes the generation of music, or the recall of video images, it is difficult to work without her. Similarly, because the choreography is informed by the way in which these devices react to her movements, she cannot fully explore the movement without me there to provide the linkage between limb and media. In this case, everything is being created at the same time. When the term collaboration is used, it sometimes means that the artists came together only in the last phase of creation. This is not the case when we work with the MidiDancer: the intensity of collaboration that is one of the wonderful side-effects of using this device.</p>
<p><b>Saggini:</b> If you think about it, technology has always been used in theatre. But in the past it was transparent, while now often happens that technology itself become the main subject of the representation.</p>
<p><b>Coniglio:</b> For some artists, it is true that the subject has become technology that they are using right in front of you. But, if you look at the history of the cinema, I think that you will see that this is a natural tendency when a technology is young. Think of the very earliest films, the ones that would frighten the audience by showing a train coming right at them. One could say that these were sensationalism only. But in fact, they were allowing the public to understand what a film was. In many ways, I feel this is the state of much of the experimental performance technology I have seen. There is a need, on the part of the artist, to make it clear what is happening. Once the audience understands these relationships, and once the technology itself moves from one of a kind prototypes to the "off-the-shelf" stage, you will see less of this kind of work.<br />
<!--nextpage--><br />
<b>Saggini:</b> What are the main influences on your work?</p>
<p><b>Coniglio:</b> Certainly for me, my teacher Morton Subotnick has been a major influence. It was because of him that I became interesting interactive performance in the first place. Mort was doing this kind of work in the mid-sixties, well before the advent of readily available digital computers. There are many ways in which he has influenced me along the way, including the some of the stylistic influences of his compositional techniques, and the way in which performers are related to the media that they control. But perhaps the most significant was that I always perceived him as an artist first, technologist second. The artworks always received the attention they deserved, even in the midst of very complex technical situations. This is something that I always strive for.</p>
<p><b>Saggini:</b> Please, describe the goal, though mutable, of your artistic and technological research.</p>
<p><b>Coniglio:</b> I would like very much to continue to improve the MidiDancer system. To me, it is an instrument that shows much promise, but there are many improvements in sensitivity that can be made. If you look at traditional instruments that have survived the test of time, they are all excellent transducers of the performer's most subtle intention. The MidiDancer does a good job of this, but it needs to be better. If the instrument is not as sensitive as the performer, the performer will eventually be limited by the instrument. Also, my work with interactive robotic devices (like the light sculpture in the Electronic Disturbance) is extremely interesting to me. Because these devices give a physical presence to the electronic data flying around the stage. I would very much like to see some little robotic performers wandering around the stage with the dancers.</p>
<p><b>Saggini:</b> Your work with the MidiDancer presents similarities - as much as differences - with that carried on by Léon Theremin during the twenties and the thirties with the Theremin and the Terpsitone. It seems to me that the main difference is that the MidiDancer is not conceived as a musical instrument but rather as a tool to control scenic devices. Do you think that this could change in the future? And have you ever played a theremin?</p>
<p><b>Coniglio:</b> I’m afraid that I cannot say that I have ever played a Theremin, though I would enjoy the opportunity to try. But what you say is true: the MidiDancer is a device that measures the flexion of the joints of the performer’s body and reports that data to a computer and no more. It only becomes a musical, or, if you will, media, instrument when the data reported to the computer is interpreted and used to manipulate sound, video, light… whatever. However, it seems to me that the Theremin (actually, all musical instruments) exhibits several properties that one should keep in mind when attempting to make use of a device that maps human gesture into another medium.</p>
<p>First, it is consistent in its interpretation of the gesture, i.e., the performer can depend on a particular gesture, or combination of gestures, to produce a particular result. Without this quality, it becomes impossible to practice and become more skilled as a performer of the instrument.</p>
<p>Second, there is a clear visual correlation between the gesture and the sonic/visual result. (This operates in tandem with my first point.) As the audience witnesses the performance, they can come to an understanding of how the instrument is played, even if the instrument is not familiar to them. This is important because, one of the reasons we go to hear music played live is that we know it is not a recording! It has been my experience that, if the audience cannot perceive the relationship between gesture and result, it will be their assumption that the performer is not actually playing the instrument. When I see a live performance, I sit in anticipation of seeing the performer exhibiting skill and improvisational ability (even if it is only in the form of interpreting pre-composed material) as they performing. It is possible that, on this night, the performer may give the performance of a lifetime, and I will be there to witness this one time event.</p>
<p>So, there is no reason that, with the appropriate programming of the software, MidiDancer could not be used purely to control the performance of music. And I have done that on many occasions. But typically, I am attempting to give the performer the ability to control an entire environment of media, because it is this sense of hybrid control that interests me at the moment.</p>
<p><b>Saggini:</b> Through <a href="http://www.troikatronix.com/" target="_blank">TroikaTronix</a> you sell software designed for artists who want to incorporate digital media into their live performance or installations. How is the feedback? And are you aware of artists using you software?</p>
<p><b>Coniglio:</b> Well, the response to <a href="http://www.troikatronix.com/isadora.html" target="_blank">Isadora®</a> (my real-time video and audio manipulation environment) has been very positive, which is very pleasing to me. I wrote Isadora primarily for my own use, and to use in teaching our workshops. But , as people saw the software, many wanted to have it. With funding for the arts very hard to come by in the United States, I saw that there may be a possibility to support Troika Ranch indirectly through the sales of Isadora, so I began to sell it online. There are about one hundred users out there now, and the number is growing daily. I would say that 75 percent are artists of one kind or another: many who are doing installations, a smaller percentage who are doing live performance. The other 25 percent are VJs (Video Jockeys) who use the software to create visuals that accompany the music in clubs and discotechques. (One of my most ardent beta testers is Italian VJ by the name of Giorgio Oliverio of <a href="http://www.softlykicking.com/" target="_blank">softlykicking.com</a>) This latter group was a surprise to me, as that is not a world that I know much about. But the number of users in this area is growing. Another notable user is <a href="http://www.barriere.org/" target="_blank">Jean-Baptiste Barriére</a> from France. He is using Isadora in combination with visual-sensing software like <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/davidrokeby/home.html" target="_blank">David Rokeby</a>’s <a href="http://www.interlog.com/~drokeby/vns.html" target="_blank">Very Nervous System</a> as a way of generating visual material for his installation work.</p>
<p><b>Saggini:</b> Is Isadora an evolution of Interactor? Can you describe this application?</p>
<p><b>Coniglio:</b> Isadora is a graphic programming environment that provides interactive control over digital media, with special emphasis on the real-time manipulation of digital video. An Isadora program is created by linking together graphically represented building blocks, each of which performs a specific function: playing or manipulating digital video, capturing live video, looking for MIDI input, controlling a DV camera, etc. By linking the modules together you can create complex interactive relationships that can be controlled in real time, either with the mouse and keyboard, or with external MIDI devices.</p>
<p>Yes, I do see it as the evolution of Interactor (I actually like to think of it as Interactor’s <i>daughter</i>.). I wanted to take the best parts of Interactor (scene based structure, easy to use interface) and add the capability of processing visual information, and the ability for third parties to write their own plugins. I will be releasing the SDK for Isadora soon, and this will allow anyone who can write code in C or C++ to make their own Isadora modules.</p>
<p><b>Saggini:</b> What are your plans for the future?</p>
<p><b>Coniglio:</b> Currenty we are hard at work preparing for the premiere of our newest evening-length work, "The Future of Memory" in Manhattan in February 2003. It will combine dance, theater, video projections, and interactive digital media to explore how memories are created, stored, romanticized, repressed and lost. The premiere will take place at The Duke on 42nd Street in Manhattan in February 2003.</p>
<p>One of the things I am doing with Isadora for this performance is to capture live video and store it in the computer as the work is performed. These visual materials reappear and are manipulated by the performers as the piece progresses. I am using Isadora and the computer as a metaphor for our own memory. It allows me to recall and present material the audience has seen earlier in the piece while simultaneously distoring it temporally or visually.</p>
<p>We will also be spending 2003 in residence at <a href="http://www.dtw.org/" target="_blank">Dance Theater Workshop</a>, an important presenter of dance in New York City. They have recently rebuilt their theater from the ground up, and added a media lab for use by its choreographer/dancer members. During the residency, we will be beginning work on our next piece, and spending some time researching possible improvements to the MidiDancer system. Measuring the angular flexion of joints has been the most obvious and useful place to begin. But now I am interested in 1) increasing the resolution of the data that I am capturing, and 2) beginning to use accelerometers to measure the "impluse" of gesture from any part of the body. This will allow me to do things like react to the speed at which the torso moves. This research will then be incorporated into the new work, which we expect to be premiered sometime in 2004.</p>
