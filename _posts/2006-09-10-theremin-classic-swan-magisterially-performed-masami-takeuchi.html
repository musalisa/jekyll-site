<p>We've heard it so many times played by <a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/link/category/29/index.html" target="_blank">Clara</a>, <a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/link/category/31/index.html" target="_blank">Lydia</a>, <a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/link/category/32/index.html" target="_blank">Peter</a> and many others. And all of us theremin lovers have tried to play it, with mixed results, at least one time. It's the theremin Classic <i>The Swan</i> by Saint-Saens.</p>
<p>Well, it is worth to listen to it one more time in this video by <a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/185/index.html" target="_blank">Masami Takeuchi</a>. Masami performs this theremin evergreen magisterially on his <a href="http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/109/1/24/index.html" target="_blank">Big Briar Series 91</a>.</p>
<p>Bravo!</p>
